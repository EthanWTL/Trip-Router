However, there were occasional complaints about greasy or overly sauced dishes."}, "service": {"rating": 2, "reason": "Service is a recurring issue, with frequent complaints about inattentive, slow, or disorganized staff, long waits for food, incorrect orders, and difficulty flagging down servers. Some reviewers also mentioned rude or unprofessional behavior."}, "environment": {"rating": 3, "reason": "The ambiance is described as casual and functional, with a smaller dining space that can feel cramped during busy times. While some appreciate the BYOB policy and lively atmosphere, others noted issues like poor table arrangements, drafty seating, and occasional cleanliness concerns."}, "value": {"rating": 3, "reason": "While many diners feel the food quality justifies the prices, others find the portions inconsistent or the prices high for the service and experience provided.
