I really liked my first lunch at Mission Taqueria, and am excited to go back for dinner and margaritas. We started with the guacamole, which was a healthy portion and served up a nice kick with chunks of jalapeño. The tortilla chips were thin and crispy. We asked for a side of salsa and were later charged $6 unexpectedly - this was removed from our check but I have noticed in the meantime that there is a salsa section on the menu that I somehow missed. To me, guac without salsa is peanut butter without jelly so this combo will sadly set me back mucho dolares in the future. 

My salad choice was the romaine and bean, to which I made a couple modifications (no cheese, vinaigrette instead of creamy dressing). I also added shrimp. This salad was filling and delicious and the shrimp were really nicely seasoned. Would order again. My dining companion's kale salad looked solid. 

We were treated to a couple fresh juices on the house and I loved the light and refreshing red pepper drink I received. It was just a touch sweet which was perfect for me. Our server, Zareen, was a doll. 

Can't wait for the visit numero dos!
**happy hour review**

This is my second time to mission for happy hour. Mission imo is a great place to take a first date because of the beautiful vintage home feel decor and dim lighting. 

The prices at happy hour are pretty competitive with average center city pricing and the drinks are surprisingly strong! Not that I'm a lightweight drinker nor do i drink heavily, but they definitely aren't watered down.

I tried the watermelon sangria ($5) and the chicken carnitas ($2 bucks each).
The watermelon sangria was made with rum, watermelon juice and a local red wine. The addition of rum was smart and gave the sangria a nice slightly spicy taste. 
The chicken carnitas were small but packed with so much meat, cilantro, onions, rosemary, tomatoes, and kale that its easy to go thru 6 in one sitting. 
I will definitely he back to try dinner one day.
All you need to know is margaritas and chips and salsa and you're in for a treat! Now I see you looking at that $9-$14 price tag for chips and salsa and thinking, "What? I'm not paying that for chips and salsa when others give it for free?" Hold up! Hear me out! At a lot of other places, the chips are just filler. Here is it quality and a centerpiece for your meal. Heck you can just make a meal out of it if you want! The tortillas here are freshly made. The salsas range greatly in flavors and heat levels from cool and creamy to tangy with heat. They're all delicious though; even the off the wall hazelnut one. Thankfully I got hooked on those chips at a Yelp Elite event here, so now I know it's worth paying the money for them. 

The margaritas are well-balanced and good pours no matter which flavor you choose. I prefer the green one though. That fresh pressed juice is as good as you'd get at any high quality juice bar, but they took it up a notch by adding tequila. If you want, you can even pretend it's healthy since you are drinking your vegetables! The tamarind and guava one's are tasty too and not too sweet. You can get salt, sugar, or nothing on the rim. 

The plantain empanadas are another good choice if you're a vegetarian or not. They have a lot of flavor. I enjoyed the Octopus tacos as well. The nutty salsa macha was the dominating flavor. 

The food has come out in a reasonable time and has been hot and fresh on all my visits. Servers are helpful when trying to decide on different menu items. Reservations aren't accepted for small parties, but the space is fairly large so I've never had to wait long.
Came here with a group for brunch on New Years Day, desperate for some sustenance and some hair of the dog. First of all, did Chip and Jo from Fixer Upper redesign this space?! Because it is straight up beautiful. The glorious bath of natural light from the windows doesn't hurt either. 

For brunch, we tried 3 salsas and guac, all of which were fine, but nothing too crazy happening there. I also shared a breakfast burrito and kale salad, both of which were bonkers good. As far as the hair of the dog goes, they have a green juice marg! Can you think of a better hungover New Years Day brunch drink, when you definitely need a hit of the good stuff but you're still clinging to your resolutions (that you're still trying to convince yourself you'll stick to all year) (but you won't) (stop lying to yourself).

All in all a great brunch spot and I'd be curious to check out lunch or dinner.
I love this new addition to Sansom street! 

Food: 4, Drinks: 5
The goat chili nachos and vegetarian tacos were very good but I heard the fish tacos are the best (if only I ate fish). The house margaritas were delicious but definitely explore the menu as they have so many cool drinks! 

Decor: 5++++ 
It's a very large space with a bar, tables, and round booths in one side of the restaurant. They even have a huge foozeball table!! It think it would be a great place to chill before going out to a club/bar.
Mexican food is my favorite so I was super excited when I heard a Mexican place was opening in the city. I want to love this place but it's so hard since Philly has so many other Mexican options. Don't get me wrong this place has such a unique and pretty decor with a chill vibe. However, the higher price and lack of options is what is holding me back. Everything tasted to expectations but nothing was a wow for me yet. For happy hour, this place is great, $5 margaritas and cheaper tacos. But for paying regular prices there are other places more worth the money. Service is great and it's a great go to spot but if you're in other parts of the city there are better Mexican places.
I hate to tear into the new player in town, but man that was a disappointing lunch. The skirt steak tacos are surprisingly tough and a plate of 3 is 15 bucks. This is very sad when a taco truck can annihilate them in terms of quality for significantly lower cost. The milanesa torta is fine, but also meets with the same problem as the tacos. It doesn't have that wow factor that I find at a place like Don Memos, who has a baller torta at a significantly lower price. 

I know Rittenhouse has expensive rent and it is tough for businesses to make it out here, but the food simply isn't great enough here. I hope that their kitchen game gets stronger and they do well. I could return one day and give them a shot to change my mind.
I am really sad to be writing this review update, but after my last visit at Mission, I cannot in good faith let my fellow Yelpers expect a higher quality experience than what they may inevitably receive.

Mission Happy Hour has been one of my all time favorites for a while, both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. While the quality of the food and drinks has remained the same, the quality of the service has taken a very steep decline.

My friends and I made a 4 PM reservation for Friday Happy Hour. Mission has started enforcing table limits, so the six of us only had 1.5 hours at our table. We were not made aware of this until we were seated which is a bit of a bummer, but it's a popular spot and they want to turn tables so that's understandable. When you have such a strict time limit, you would hope that your service would be prompt during that time window but sadly that was not the case.

We were greeted and given a bottle of water for the table. Then our waitress disappeared never to be seen again. Seriously - I think she left. We ended up having a new waitress come by to ask if we were being taken care of (about 10 minutes after we had been seated). She brought us more water because the bottle was not very big to begin with and this heat wave had us all sweating. The fact that Mission does not seem to have air conditioning did not help. I will note that there are ceiling fans and in some areas of the restaurant they work just fine, but where we were seated was HOT.

It took about 20 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive. Not great... but our food orders came very quickly. I'm a huge fan of the carnitas tacos and the esquites. I like the mix the two together because the combo is very tasty. 

As our hour and a half continued, we saw our waitress very few times. We had to flag her down to put in additional drink orders. It got to the point that we felt like she hated us... when our hour and a half was up we were ready to get the heck out of there and find somewhere with functional air conditioning and attentive service. We once again had to flag our waitress down to ask for the check to which she promptly ignored us and almost glared at us (but that may be me reading into it too much...) and went to take care of a different table. A few minutes later she returned and we finally asked for the check.

When we got the check I was not shocked to see that an automatic 20% gratuity was applied. Now I will say that 20% is typically the lowest percentage tip that I will leave, because I have worked in the service industry and get it. However, it makes me really frustrated when a server does the bare minimum because they know they'll be getting that 20% regardless of the service. I honestly wish I would have asked to speak to a manager to let them know about the experience while I was there but it was not worth spending another minute in that heat. 

I will sadly be removing Mission from my list of Happy Hour go-tos, and maybe consider it as a takeout spot for the future.
Mission is my new obsession. Seriously.. if you haven't been here yet, you are missing out. 

The dark, somewhat dingy Nodding Head was literally transformed into a bright, airy, fun Mexican "beer garden" complete with shuffleboard, foosball tables, large picnic tables, plants, and an awesome atmosphere. I liked it the instant I walked up the stairs. My friend and I came for dinner on a Thursday around 7:30 and waited about 20 minutes for a table. We went to the crowded bar and ordered some drinks. It wasn't happy hour anymore, but the HH deals looked  pretty legit. They have a bunch of different margarita options, but we opted for the Austin Eastcider. If you haven't have this cider yet, it's pineapple cider, not too sweet, and overall amazing. I discovered it at Bok Bar this summer so I was extremely happy to see it being served at Mission!

We got seated pretty soon after we ordered drinks. The service was great. We never had an empty dish on our table for more than a few minutes without someone taking it away and we never had to wait for water refills. I really was impressed, considering how busy and chaotic the place seemed. 

I do agree with some of the other reviews that the prices seem a little steep. However, it seems that they added a tasting menu which is the BEST deal. It was only 25 dollars each and was a ton of food. It comes with 3 salsas, 2 empanadas, 2 ceviches, and one of the large plates. The only thing you're really allowed to pick is the large plate- the rest is decided for you. My friend doesn't like ceviche, so she asked if she could sub one of the ceviches for tortilla soup. At first, our server was a little hesitant but then he agreed to it, which was really nice of him. 

The salsas were served as a trio and came with salsa fresca (big chunks of fresh tomato), salsa verde (a little bit of a kick), and the coconut-hazelnut (our absolute favorite- so creamy and delicious). The empanadas were delicious and cheesy-- I could have eaten many more of them myself. The ceviche was the north atlantic fluke which was a little heavy on the lime, but the fish was fresh and it was a nice light dish. The tortilla soup was a little spicy and super flavorful. We got the marinated pork shoulder as our entree and it was so much food, we ended up taking more than half of it home. The pork was very tender and came with tortillas, delicious pickled red onions, and salsa verde. For 25 bucks each, you can't afford not to do the tasting menu!

My only regret was not getting the churros. I will be back for them. And all the food. Probably next week.
The staff here was great! We arrived at the very beginning of happy hour so we had our choice of seats and the attention of the hostess who, after we told her we were from out of town, proceeded to help us out with making plans for the next day / evening. She was so friendly and helpful, we followed her advice all weekend!

Starters: Guac and chips were good, I typically like mine a little spicier, but it was well made! The spicy margaritas were very good!

The tacos are served in 3's (which was perfect for the three of us!) - we had al pastor, carnitas, and I don't remember the name of the last one, but it was lamb tongue. Al pastor all the way! The carnita was also good. As for the tongue... the sauce on it was very good, but the meat texture just wasn't for me. The staff highly recommended it, but I think that's for the more adventurous types!

The space is very open and everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves. They have a gender neutral bathroom setup (nice!) and they have seating at the bar, large tables, hightops, and a window seat (where we picked). There was also a foosball table that wasn't being used, but I'm sure could be a nice added treat!

We wanted to try one more drink so they directed us downstairs to Oyster House - again, the staff is so friendly! 

If I'm back in Philly for happy hour, I'd be happy to visit again!
There is just something about this place that seems to bug me.  Maybe it's the amount of food to price ratio that really hits it home for my dislike.  The staff and atmosphere are great and enjoyable if i just went for drinks, however it is hard to hear the person sitting next o you on a Saturday.  

For the food
-Snacks
For the price i think the salsa should be unlimited salsa and chips.  I miss the days of tacos in the burbs with free chips and great salsa.  The salsa was good but just ok for the amount.

The Guacamole did not have a good balance of jalapeno to other ingredients.  I did not notice any spice at all to it.  

The Nachos were pretty good,  one of the better items so far.

-Tacos
The steak taco was ok but the slices of steak were hard to bite through.  This causing the issue of ending up with most of the steak in your mouth with one bite.  The flavors were ok.  We suggested to the staff that day that they should chop the steak up before serving so you can get the perfect bite.

Al Pastor was decent, nothing i want to write home about.  If we think $13 for 3 small tacos is a great deal then this place is for you. 

The only real taco that seems to be a decent protein to taco ratio have been the Mahi Mahi tacos.  If my girlfriend drags me here again against my will i will stick to this.  

The Chorizo taco had me wanting to throw it against the wall and walk out.  You took a 6 inch pieice of sausage and cut it up between 3 tacos?  For the price you have given me the smallest amount of meat per taco and it was just laughable.  The amount of fish on one mahi mahi taco was equal to the amount of chorizo that i had.  

Maybe the value in this place hides in the Platos Grande that are to be split.  It is not a place i would like to go again for tacos, maybe a drink or two.
If I could make an amendment to the Constitution and make 3 tacos per order people's birth right, I would. But at Mission you don't have to cross your fingers and wish for 3 and not 2 tacos (lots of places are selling 2tacos for $12 these days :o)! Like Ricky Martin sang- Un, Dos, Tres Maria!!! They make their corn tortilla in house from fresh fair trade corn that they grind themselves (who does that?). It was my first time eating a fresh tortilla, it was quite the epiphany. Not to mention they have Tongue Tacos on the menu, my favorite, and it tasted fantastic! Apart from tacos, there are innovative salsas, guac and many traditional Mexican snacks & entrees. 

Gone is the batcave of yesteryears that used to be beloved Nodding Head and enter super inviting, warm and welcoming gigantic open space that Mission is with friendly waitstaff. The margaritas are lip-smacking (you gotta try the Guava, I have had 3 so far) and am truly appreciative of all the quality ingredient that goes into making them so you don't get a nasty hangover the next day. If you love Gin don't forget to try the Verano cocktail. It is the most refreshing drink I have had all summer. Mission also has a impressive selection of Mezcal as well.

I am happy the city has another excellent hangout spot at 15th & Samsom (Oscar's can get old...) and hope they continue to be there for years to come!
Mission Taqueria is a really fun place to meet up no matter what the occasion is. This place is perfect for small groups, large groups, one on one, etc. Come here for dinner, just drinks, brunch, a quick bite between other places. This place is really for every occasion and every mood. The one thing this place is not, however, is authentic. It's a hipster spin on tacos and TexMex (which does not mean the food here is bad!) but it's something to be aware of if you plan on coming here. 

The decor here is amazing. Lots of Instagramable corners and details. Especially the center of the restaurant that has been turned into an enclosed garden of sorts. 

But it's also really pricey. I love the unique drink combinations on their menu and they all taste delicious but they're also all very watered/mixed down. The food here is all delicious you can't really go wrong ordering.
Good food with cool ambience. Fun place to hang with friends. Only downside was with pricing-- I ordered one salsa assuming it would be $3 (normally 3 salsas for $9), but was charged $6. Small downside, but would have liked to know pricing upfront. Otherwise a good experience!
Love Mission Taqueria. Found out about this place through a Yelp event (thanks yelp!). Decided to bring my boyfriend this time so he could experience it. They have some of the best margaritas here and they don't skimp on the alcohol. My favorite by far is the green juice margie with a chili rim. Very refreshing. I had the nachos (very healthy) and my boyfriend had the shrimp tacos. Both were good. The service was kinda meh. It was the end of the the night so I kinda get it but still...But other than that this is a great place to bring friends with its open, light and airy venue. If anything just go for a drink.
I heard that Mission Taco was supposed to have some of the best tacos for lunch in the city, so I was very happy to suggest it to a coworker a few days ago.

After we sat down and perused the menu, we realized that the Oaxacan Express lunch special is probably the best deal in the city. $15 = agua fresca + ceviche or soup + full order of tacos. Since the tacos by themselves will run you $13-15, you can't do better. 

I chose the hibiscus fresca, with al pastor tacos and ceviche. The ceviche was divine and contained plenty of variety in the seafood, with chunks of peppers and a spicy dressing (I did end up tasting jalapeño oil all day afterward). The tacos were filled with a generous amount of pork and the tortillas were the perfect vehicle for the filling. The hibiscus fresca was very sweet, but it was easy to finish when I cut it with some tap water.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the airy space that appeared before me when I reached the top of the staircase. It was very comfortable inside the restaurant, and there was plenty of space to accommodate a lunch crowd. I will be back.
I have been looking forward trying this place out since it opened.  It was busy around 8 on a Saturday night but the super nice hostess said she had 2 seats available at the end of a communal table. Cool with us. The waiter came by and gave us water and then took the order of the people we were sitting at the communal table with.  So we waited a little bit...then waited some more. I noticed he took the order of the people sitting behind us (who were seated after us), not a big deal. Then a few minutes later he took the order of the people sitting at another table next to us (who were seated after us). We then waited a few more minutes and we still had not even been asked for a drink order (we had been sitting there for 30 minutes at this point). We sadly decided to just get up and leave b/c we were starving. I might try it again b/c it could have been some sort of weird misunderstanding but it was a big disappointment.
This is the happy hour version of El Vez and Tequilas! This place was converted from Nodding Head, and made super bright, open and fun. With some brick walls, booths, bench seating and a Foosball table. I love the little balcony area in the middle! We came here for a work happy hour, so it was quite loud but lively! Their fish tacos and guacamole were excellent. I also really liked the hummus, it tasted a bit chocolaty/vanilly, which was super interesting. The drinks are nice and strong, so you will only need a few. They have great happy hour specials for drinks and food. I would pass on the nachos, they were not melty or cheesey enough for my tastes.

I would definitely come back to check out the desserts!
The tacos here are no doubt authentic and delicious, but the servings are very small, and not worth the price. It can also get really packed during happy hour.
Such a cute restaurant located on the upstairs of the oyster house. Great service, hostess was quick to seat, waitress came by almost immediately, and was always attentive. 

We had:

Guacamole: comes with chips and these were DELICIOUS. Nice portion size. Definitely great appetizer. 

Esquites: $5 and was so good, not slathered with cheese, and not overly seasoned either. It was nice and light and went well with the chips. 

Fluke Ceviche: here's where my minus 1 star for this place is. This dish was STRONG. Like really excessively washed down with lime juice from a bottle and olive oil. I'm not sure if this is just the taste and style of this dish but I REALLY wish the waitress would've given me a little heads up for this one. Personally, I wouldn't recommend. This was virtually inedible had it not been for the chips and guacamole by its side to help dilute the flavor. 

Fried Mahi Tacos: these were great! Nice and airy, and the dish was definitely fresh.
If you're ~on a mission~ for a good little hipster taqueria....... 

Look no further than Mission Taqueria. 

This place is really good. The location is super chic/modern but homey at the same time. It's the perfect casual cool hangout, almost like if Urban Outfitters decided to add a taco bar to their stores. It has a completely different vibe than most places in Philly. 

The food is flavorful and there are a lot of interesting combinations on the menu. I tried the baby gem salad and nachos and they were both delicious. A little pricey, but delicious. The baby gem salad had smashed potatoes in it that added such an interesting little flair. A lot of the items are like that, with just a little extra zazz thrown in to keep things interesting. 

The service was also quick during lunch time. From my experience, the food and everyone working there was wonderful!
Mission Taqueria is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in philly! Not only do they have a great happy hour, but the regular menu is reasonably priced as well. My favorite is the green juice margie and the chicken tacos. But honestly, everything is delicious. It is a great fun atmosphere in here, but it can get really loud and crowded.
As a Sansom Street native, any new place will be a welcomed addition to the dumpster-ladened block. Given that Mission Taqueria was born from it's neighbor Oyster House (which is situated below Mission Taqueria), there was high expectation as Oyster House is a local favorite of mine. 

Walking into the door next to Oyster House and up the steps into a predominately white space was awesome. It was totally unexpected but in a good way. The table football (aka foosball) and communal tables will immediately make this an awesome spot to come with a group of friends and hang out. Unfortunately, with all the hardwood and open areas, the loudness is something you'll have to deal with. But after requesting three seats at a table, we were ushered to the back side of the restaurant where it was a little quieter.

Upon looking at the menu, there was an interesting mix of items. It was disappointing to see salsa and chips as an item you must purchase on the menu but given that there was over five varieties, I guess it would make sense to charge for them. But damn, $14 for 5 salsas? Seems pretty pricey so we decided to get the guacamole instead ($10) which fell kind of short of expectation. For me, guacamole is all about balance and texture, both which were lacking here with over the top lime and cilantro flavors and a mushy-mouth feel. In addition, the chips were nothing to write home about either. Looking back, it may have been a better call to order the nachos ($14). But there are plenty of other interesting items which I will need to explore on another visit. 

Moving onto the tacos which come three per order, the three of us decided to do a full swap so we would each be able to try three. We ended up geting the steak ($15), mahi mahi ($15) and cabrito (goat, $13) given that one of my dining companions doesn't eat pork (obviously would have gotten the pastor if that wasn't the case). The tacos came out in a timely matter despite common grand opening woes. The cabrito, paired with feta and currants, were great. The funkiness of the feta was cut with the sweetness of the currants and paired great with the minute gaminess of the goat. Despite being small, flavors were on point and clearly worked. Unfortunately, i couldn't say the same thing about next item: skirt steak. The meat was under seasoned and the jalapeno relish was indistinguishable from a regular salsa. The mahi mahi was ranked in the middle of the two; it had the flavors of a baja taco but the fish was dry, leading to a textural combination that was unlike what you would find south of the border.

All in all, a decent start to another welcomed-addition to Sansom Street. While the prices are high ($100 after tip and tax for guac, 3 orders of tacos, and 3 drinks) for what you're getting (tiny tacos), I could see this place could be a big hit with locals. In addition, the service was great for the the opening night. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu.
Let me begin by saying RIP Nodding Head Brewery.

I walked up the stairs to Mission Taqueria feeling a familiarity from previous dining experiences but there was something off. As I summited the top of the staircase, I was confused, hungry, and curious.

Notes:
- Cultural appropriation: https://philly.eater.com/2016/10/5/13176804/south-philly-barbacoa-mission-taqueria-tacos-philly
- The menu is over priced
- The service (at least on this Friday night but we were a huge table) was D+ at best. Huge lag times on food and drink delivery from ordering. I am not sure if this is the wait staff or the kitchen. If it's the wait staff, purely shameful. If it's the kitchen, I am confused. You're making street food -- a cuisine that is inherently quick. Either way, pretty disappointing.
- The check I got from the group bill bolded a suggested gratuity in a way that made it seem like they were trying to trick drunk 20 somethings into paying a lot more than they owed. The format of the receipt was incredibly misleading and obviously a direct representation of the owner's business practices.
- They ran my card twice. Honest mistake perhaps but my forgiveness was running out. It appears that they put the wrong price in first and then had to rerun it.

I will not return.
Another place with great happy hour drink and food specials! Their $5 well made high quality margaritas can't be beat! Its located upstairs from oyster house. The decor is fresh and bright, the space is big with unisex bathrooms. We stayed at the bar had a few margaritas, chips, salsa, and guacamole. Our bartender was great friendly but not in the way. Even though we never tried the food it looked and smelled great. They had regular table seating as well as picnic style table and benches by the bar. Will definitely be back!
I had a great spicy house margie to start the night. We ordered nachos as a starter and each of us ordered our own tacos. My partner ordered the tongue tacos which he said were pretty good. I tried them and was not a fan of the texture- first time trying tongue!

I ordered the steak tacos which were quite disappointing. Our server said they were the best, but I struggled to take a bite because the meat would not separate between bites. Our server also took our napkins after we finished our starter, so we looked like a mess trying to eat our entrees. 

Overall, I may come back. I just don't understand the hype on paying $$$ for a baby taco!  Luckily this place gives you 3 per order.
I have found my new favorite margarita and taco bar! The interior of Mission is bright, clean and happy- tons of natural light, light-colored wood, and plants hanging everywhere. The servers were attentive and super friendly as well.

Their drinks are delicious- I had the "draft margarita" and the Paloma. I especially liked that they weren't too sweet and they were not made with any sour mix. Everything tasted fresh and handcrafted. We also tried the chips and guac.

I really hope they extend their hours for lunch and maybe add a happy hour at some point!
One of the best brunch places in center city. Mission is on Sansom street and is a very sos IOU's place on the 2nd floor of its building. The place is very big and bright. For brunch I had the breakfast burrito which was the best breakfast burrito I ever had. The potatoes eggs and avocado made a delicious combination. My friend and I both had margaritas that were great and strong. The prices were very reasonable and I'll be back for sure
This is a beautiful, sunny space! I walked in and was super impressed by the open, inviting layout, cheerful looking decor and the gigantic foosball table right by the entrance. Definitely sets the tone for a great brunch. 

We ordered chips, salsa and guac for the table to share (with unlimited refills of chips!) - all tasty. I also tried the shrimp taco, mahi mahi taco, and steak taco. My favorite by far is the mahi mahi - it's battered and fried and has the most delicate, light texture to it. Shrimp was good and flavorful too, and the steak taco was good but just a tad chewy. All of the tacos come with a side of cubed melon sprinkled with some sort of spice. They also serve La Colombe coffee for a great pick-me-up in the morning. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, although it was a little on the pricier side ($15 for a serving of three smallish tacos - although I was full by the end of the meal with the chips and guac).
Came to this restaurant on a Friday night with my friend to celebrate her 21st birthday!! The decor in this restaurant is fabulous, very trendy with hanging plants, different lights and a very open atmosphere. It was very crowded, but for 2 people we didn't have to wait long at all for a table. 

Upon sitting down, our waitress was very helpful in letting us know how the place works, mentioning how the menu is meant to be "shared" which is great. We ordered drinks, which were pricey for their size but very tasty with great names! We wanted to order the taco tasting featured on the menu to share, but apparently that's the 1 thing on the menu that you can't share?? So we ended up ordering things off the normal menu. The hazelnut coconut salsa was INCREDIBLE, like nothing I have tasted before. The verde salsa was fresh and very tasty as well. We ordered steak tacos to share, which were a bit rare but very good as well!

My overall experience was good, but the prices were a bit high for the amount of food given especially for something like salsa and chips. I would recommend to friends for the location and atmosphere though!
Visiting Philadelphia last night and this place was fantastic. Awesome happy hour prices and food. Highly recommend. A bit loud so if you're looking for quiet best not to come here.
The measure between a three- and a four-star restaurant, simply put, is whether or not I'd go out of my to eat there. Mission is a Center City restaurant, and so it's in a densely populated area (especially for lunch), so it doesn't necessarily need to be a destination restaurant to survive. This is a Center City problem.

I found the food to be pretty good. I enjoyed my agua fresco, the spicy butternut squash soup, and the carne asada tacos. All well-prepared with no real complaints. Satisfactory and hospitable service, and just a beautiful transformation of the old Nodding Head place. I recommend going there if you're in the area.

If you're not, there's plenty of good (and cheaper) taco spots in town. They may not be as trendy, but they might be even tastier. So three-stars for now.
A lively Mexican Cantina = Mission!!  My daughter lives in Philly and goes to Mission often.  She wanted me to enjoy it just has much as she has.   We started with the Guacamole with the right amount of heat.   We shared the tacos dorados, shrimp & mango served with sweet corn and avocado.  Delishhhh!  In addition we ordered the Tacos Carnitas and also a big hit.  They also have a good drink menu and we had the classic margaritas.  Looking forward to my next trip to Philly to come back to Mission and try something else.
The passive aggressive response from management has brought this down to a one star review. Congratulations for seating us promptly without reservations. Unfortunately it's not enough to warrant a higher rating because the star of the show should be the entrees. Your poor quality, old food is not something deserving of a higher star rating. Unlike the majority of your guests, we are not drunken college kids so our expectations are higher. Nasty "sparkling wine" served in a juice glass, chewy, poor quality short rib and mahi mahi that tastes so fishy it seems like either just came out of the sea or in the more likely case, just came out of your expired inventory are not going to get you a five star review or a return visit. A nice manager and a friendly server are not going to bring us back to eat your crappy food and drink your awful wine. Your unprofessionalism has absolutely solidified that we will never return to your establishment and I will most definitely pass my opinion along to as many people as possible as I already have. You obviously don't really care because you were more interested in being snarky for the public to see versus writing a message to me directly about my experience. I would love it if you would message me contact information for whoever your supervisor is so I can contact them about your poor attitude. Otherwise, I certainly don't mind doing the research to find it myself. Happy to new year to you as well. Enjoy the frat house you're running. Luckily for you, drunk college kids don't care about your crappy food

Mission Taqueria is not an easy place to rate.  This loud, airy, and very popular new Mexican cantina and bar has certainly found a large clientele and yet the food doesn't quite live up to many other Mexican restaurants in the Philadelphia area.  The carnitas tacos were the best food item of the evening and since this is technically a taqueria that is important.  The sopa was not very flavorful although it had a wealth of ingredients. The chicken wings with a habanero pineapple glaze were def decent although not memorable .... but I would order them again.  Don't worry about the food being being too spicy here, it isn't (unfortunately). The bartenders and kitchen service were very good and friendly and they were dealing with a huge crowd.  Def props to them.  There's picnic style tables in addition to regular restaurant-type seating, a cool gazebo-like niche in the middle of the restaurant for a medium size party, and they have Fußball (foosball) & shuffleboard tables.  Its likeability brings Mission Taqueria up to four stars.
Happy hour review- yes yes yes! $2 tacos, let's go. This is a very sunny, plant-filled space and it feels good to share "picnic tables" with other guests. We were on a happy hour hunt so the extremely quick service was perfect. We were in and out in less than 15 minutes, even though this is a sit-down place. We got the chicken tacos and carnitas tacos. Both have tender meat, with the carnita's sauce being more tomato-y and the chicken taco sauce a little spicier. The tortilla has corn mixed in so it's not the double layer flour tortilla you might get somewhere else.
I came here on a Friday night in a group of 3 around 6:15pm and was told there would be a 15-30 minute wait. The wait ended up being more like 40 minutes. We were seated around 6:55pm, but our waiter was very kind and told us we could still order off the Happy Hour menu even though it was ending at 7pm, so my dad and I ordered $3 Coronas.

To eat, I had the Quesadilla de Hongos (crimini mushrooms, cheddar, truffle, and roasted jalapeño salsa) which was fantastic. My parents shared 4 Carnitas tacos (crispy pork and salsa roja) which they enjoyed.

My mom is a really picky eater, but our waitress was very patient and accommodating; she answered all of my mom's questions and requested that ingredients be put on the side without a problem.

Pros: beautiful space (light and airy with a ton of plants), great customer service, delicious food

Cons: small portions for the price (particularly the tacos), can get crowded and loud
I'm sorta feeling torn with this review. I do like this place. The food is good, the space is really nice and they have a nice drink list. But there are just a few things that knock it down to three stars. 

First, I think the food and drinks are little pricey for what you get.  But this is smack dab in center city so I guess that's typical. Also, there is nothing to absorb sound so it gets loud. While all the servers are really friendly, and they seem just a tad off (shared appetizer served without side plates and entree came out too soon after the appetizer was served)

On the plus side, it really is a pretty fun, trendy spot.  It's more of a place to grab a few drinks and something to nibble on than a dinner destination place, at least in my opinion.  The chips with the different dips (you can pick from 5) is really good as are the shrimp tacos.   I also really like they have a fun selection of non-alcoholic beverages (although some were as expensive as an actual drink).  The Paloma is spot on!
So I wanted to like this place more thann I did   It's got a major cool vibe, which counts for a lot with restaurants. I loved the plants all over and very contemporary vibe if the tables. Sadly we ended up with the small midday menu that's available from 3-5. I'd encourage you to come for lunch or dinner instead. I'm assuming those menus are more robust. 

We started with green salsa and chips. Both were good but not life changing. I love that this place leaves the bottles of water on the tables. I had just flown in and was super thirsty. The drinks were good - I loved the super spicy tomato mix for my michelada but it was too spicy for my friend. The guys got cocktails and really enjoyed them. I ordered thhe chicken tortilla SOOOO because it was snowing. The flavor was smoky, which I like, but it was not a favorite. 

We ordered a smorgasbord of tacos, chicken mole, fish, cauliflower, carnitas, al pastor (which wasn't on the midday menu). Served traditional style with onion AABE cilantro plus nice house made hot sauce. 

The star of the show was the churros. We got two orders. Their dulce de leche was the best EVER. I will try it again for dinner on a return visit.
I honestly still can't believe that this place used to be Notting Head. This Mexican cantina is a mix of a bar, an oversized foosball table, a shuffleboard table, picnic tables, and booths. Its difficult to rate this place because its definitely not your average restaurant. 
We came for dinner, and our 30 minute wait turned into 45mins at least. So not off to a good start... but the foosball table kept us entertained. 
We started with nachos - which were bleh because cheese was rock solid on there so it was difficult to pull off pieces and it overall didnt have much flavor
The mushroom tacos and guac were fantastic. For vegetarians, I would definitely recommend both!
The chicken tacos and quesadilla were again pretty average. Nothing super exciting or memorable. 
The churros are fantastic - just get them, you wont regret it. 

This place was a fun casual place to grab a drink and some food. It was loud (people were playing heads up at dinner) but it went with the super casual, lively vibe of the place. The food was good, not great, but the atmosphere and decor definitely brings it up to four stars.
I'm really hooked with their tacos. My husband loves the grilled wild shrimp. I tried the fried Mahi Mahi-mahi. The fish is perfectly cooked with jalapeño mayonnaise that gives it a kick. Very friendly staff. I ordered mine to go and the food came out fast. The reason I took a star down is because it's not handicapped accessible because of the pretty long stairs. 

Great interior, very clean, and definitely an improvement from the previous restaurant (Nodding Head)

Cannot wait to try more
**happy hour review**

This is my second time to mission for happy hour. Mission imo is a great place to take a first date because of the beautiful vintage home feel decor and dim lighting. 

The prices at happy hour are pretty competitive with average center city pricing and the drinks are surprisingly strong! Not that I'm a lightweight drinker nor do i drink heavily, but they definitely aren't watered down.

I tried the watermelon sangria ($5) and the chicken carnitas ($2 bucks each).
The watermelon sangria was made with rum, watermelon juice and a local red wine. The addition of rum was smart and gave the sangria a nice slightly spicy taste. 
The chicken carnitas were small but packed with so much meat, cilantro, onions, rosemary, tomatoes, and kale that its easy to go thru 6 in one sitting. 
I will definitely he back to try dinner one day.
Finally I had the chance to have a sit down dinner here. It's 5:30 and it's already crowded.

Empanadas: it's fresh and soft but still had crispness. It's not thick at all. Flavor is on point. Not too greasy. Highly recommend.

What I like about the dinner menu is you can order one taco so you can try different kinds 

Short rib taco is okay. It's spicy and that's all I tasted. You can pass on it.

Cauliflower tacos: they are amazing. The cauliflower is not hard but still maintains the form. It's accompanied with beets and sunflower seeds served on turmeric soft shells with a slice of avocado. When you bite the whole thing the flavor comes together and made great combination. I can eat them all night.

Shrimp tacos are my husband's usual so I assume it's good.

My friend had mole taco and she said it's spicy.

Fried plantain was served with cheese. It's okay I think it's overly charred.

Tres leches: the citrus pure and chopped mango gives a refreshing touch to the cake. The cake is a regular vanilla cake not too sweet but it's not soaked as I expected but I don't mind at all. So if you're expecting a soaking cake it's not for you. Overall it's ok. You can pass on it.

I took a star down because our server took his time and checked other tables to come over when I raised my hand for his service.
By far, this is one of the best happy hours of the city. The spicy margaritas with jalapeno are to-die for (and dangerous). The bar snacks during happy hours are the perfect bites. The guacamole is nothing fussy - just a great, classic one. The sweet-spicy-tangy pineapple habanero sauce is one of the best wing flavors in town. Plus, $2 quality tacos. 

If you stay for dinner, it quiets down pretty quickly after 7 p.m. With the perfectly Instagram-able atmosphere and a friendly staff, this is definitely a Midtown shining star.
Ambience was a nice surprise. 
They have the largest football table I've ever seen! 

Ate from their "in between" menu (after lunch / not quite dinner. 
Chips/salsa-guac = 5 stars *****
Mahi tacos = 5 stars *****
Empanadas = 4.5 stars ****

Drinks were unique and delicious.
They're located upstairs of oyster house on Sansom St. I had such a great experience here. I was able to call the day of and get a reservation for the time I wanted. I did have to wait 15 minutes or so for a table when I got there, but there is a shuffle board table which made time go by fast. Service was super quick, drink prices were not bad at all. Food is on the pricey side for Mexican, but not unexpected for the location! It is a little bit limited on the options. I tried the carnitas tacos and the shrimp tacos, both delicious! The shrimp tacos have jalapeños in it which gave it quite a bit of a kick. The proportions of the chips and salsa was a bit weird though, they gave a lot of chips, but the tiniest bowl of salsa which was more like pico than salsa... They close at 10pm which is perfect time to head out to the nearby bars after!
Mission has easily become one of my new favorites in Center City. The ambiance is trendy, with cute little window seat tables, an open space garden, and table games. When I went to dine on a Thursday evening, the place was packed and very lively. Without reservations, the wait only lasted about 20 minutes and it was easy to pass the time by taking a little tour & grabbing a drink at the bar. 

The food did not disappoint. A friend and I shared the sampler for $25 per person which came with 3 salsas, 2 empanadas, 2 ceviches, and an entree to share. I subbed the ceviche for tortilla soup which had a kick to it. The coconut hazelnut salsa was the stand out small plate, though all were delicious. The other highlight of the meal was the pork shoulder entree. The menu stated this dish serves 4 and we had plenty leftover to spare. I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items & the dessert!
What draws me to Mission Taqueria is that it's such a gorgeous, inviting place; so I suggested to a friend that we check it out for lunch (before the main lunch crowd hits). Once entering from the street, we were easily drawn up the beautiful brick & wood stairway to the second floor.

Bridget our server was very sweet and attentive, welcoming us in and assuring that we knew about some of the great specials and options. Pretty much we were just hungry for the tacos, and worked diligently to maneuver around the tempting alcoholic beverages (being a work day)! 

She did bring some interesting water to the table; an electrolyte/sodium tinge will certainly lace your first sip of the water, but then it goes down expectantly smooth thereafter. I don't know what makes the Mission water unique, but it served its purpose to wake up the taste buds!

I'm so used to restaurants that set complimentary chips and salsa out on the table, when you order entrees; just be aware that this is not one of those places. Essentially, you'd be paying for any of the salsa and then you'd get the chips with it. No biggie. 

Our tacos came out and served beautifully, with a side of sumptuous, crispy-skinned roasted sweet potatoes. The fresh flavors of the tacos were delicious; mine were the Chicken with Mole Negro and his were the Mahi Mahi fish - both made with delectable house-made tortillas. I was a little disappointed in the petite size of the tacos; but I remind myself that one is really paying for ambiance at a place like this.

The chicken was perfectly done, moist, and falling apart as perfectly cooked chicken does. I believe the chicken was a mix of white and dark meat. The mole negro had the perfect balance of saucy chocolate base with the right amount of heat to accent it.

In turn, the Mahi Mahi tacos were a nice hunk of tempura-esque batter of delicious seafood fare.

Absolutely there is more to Mission Taqueria lunch than the tacos. You could grab salad, a sandwich, a burrito, or go for the Oaxacan Express lunch serving, which comes with soup + single taco + drink for $15.

So if you want a great place to dine with your party, or even a treat to yourself, Mission Taqueria is a wonderful little mexican-inspired oasis in the hip Sansom Street corridor between Broad Street and Rittenhouse Square.
I cannot wait to come back to this beautiful restaurant. Such a cool atmosphere and our waiter was hilarious. The drinks are strong and the tacos are so well made! Love the energy and the design.
A beautiful & fun place for lunch, happy hour, or dinner.

The space itself is bright and clean - feeling both huge and intimate when you're surrounded by friends eating some tacos.

During my various visits over the years, I've had almost all of the Salsas (my favorite is the Verde Crudo or the surprising Coconut Habenero). The tacos are delicious and addictive (but tiny!) The Happy Hour tacos are always a great deal / easy to keep ordering.

The drinks are also always delicious. The various fresh margaritas are crisp and bright. 

Service has always been super friendly, accommodating and welcoming.
Very cute place with good food and great service.  I like the tables with benches.  The menu is small, which I like, and all of the food is prepared from scratch. The tacos are delicious, small with homemade tortillas. They even make their own horchata.  The directions from Google Maps is a little off.  It directed us through the alley into the entrance.  I wouldn't walk that way because you can enter right from the sidewalk in front.  I would go back again.
Delicious tacos, good prices, friendly service, and a nice ambiance. I went here for lunch yesterday after the line at Goldie was too long and I am so glad I did. The portion of shrimp was very good and I left feeling satisfied.
This new Mexican spot re-imagines and maximizes the space once completely under-utilized by Nodding Head.  The bar is great, tile work on and behind the bar is impressive.  Drink selection is what you would expect, other CC bars have better tequila offerings, but this is acceptable.  The little atrium in the center is awesome, took me a few minutes to realize it was open air.  

With that said, the food was so so.   I wouldn't want to sugar coat the food by any other classification.  The guac was what you would expect at a basic suburban party, no real defining flavor, and way too much citrus.  I had high expectation for the tacos, they just weren't good.  Tried the chorizo rojo, grilled skirt steak, and the mahi mahi...nothing I would go back for, mahi was by far the best, but even the flash frying was not done right.  With the right leadership in the kitchen, these could all be easily correctable, it's a shame to see such laziness accepted.

Even though the food was less than average, I'll be back, but only for drinks.
So much to say! So many good things.
First things first, I posted a question this afternoon about happy hour and the owner responded very promptly! I was so excited I headed over right after work.

The happy hour is amazing! $6 house margaritas. They are delicious. My friend and I also got chips and guacamole...duh! And I got 2 chicken tacos ($2 each!!!!!!) and my friend got a veggie sopa! Holy shit I'm so impressed. So cheap and so delicious. We got three margs each and were feeling a little tipsy! 

The friggin aesthetic is also legit as hell!!! It's so chic and hip. If I didn't have an interview tomorrow to prep for, I would still be there right now. This is 100% my new spot. This is also the BEST deal I've found in the city for a Mexican HH! 

Next time I'm definitely getting the fish tacos and nachos. They seriously looked dope. I will be back here FOR SURE!
This has become my go to spot in Philly for Happy Hour, lunch or even just for drinks. The atmosphere is bright and airy. They have picnic tables, regular tables and booth like areas. I know for Happy Hour the picnic tables are sit as you please so you could be sitting next to others not in your group. The tacos are great and I love the variety. Their drinks are amazing and strong. My go to is always the hibiscus sangria which is pretty strong and I'm not a typical sangria drinker because it typically tastes like juice but not this one! The service has always been impeccable from the hostess to great you when you enter, to the bartenders and waitresses. This is a spot I will always recommend whether for lunch, happy hour, dinner.
As usual esquites is a good appetizer. Also the plantain empanadas are another option. Each is filled with mashed sweet plantains.

Quinoa salad is perfectly cooked. I added shrimps that have great flavor and complement really well with the quinoa. They are medium sized shrimps.

Choco tacos are awesome. Not too sweet covered with chopped peanuts. Great way to end the meal.
Came in with my family at about 730 on a Saturday. They said it would definitely be less than 20 minutes so we decided to get a drink at bar. I had hibiscus sangria which was ok. My brother had the frozen margarita which was pretty good. After about 30 minutes I checked with the hostess and there seemed to be a lot of confusion. We were finally seated about 10 minutes later. This place is TRENDY. The crowd is 20-30 years old and look like they are out to be seen. It's loud so hard to have a conversation. The waitress was friendly and food was delivered very quickly. The corn side was quite good. The quesadilla was too spicy. Sort of unexpectedly so. My Dad enjoyed the goat tacos. The ingredients seemed fresh but the prices are a little high for the portion size. Not sure I'd come again but definitely a cool space to go out with friends.
I have been here for happy hour (free marg with an order of tacos!) and a Saturday afternoon with a group (including three children). It is a great airy spot with bench seating. We were able to seat 8 together without a reservation. 

Recommend doing a taco share with friends so you can get them all: Mahi Mahi, Lamb Taco and Carnita Tacos were amazing! The Original Margaritas wasn't great but the Watermelon Margarita is worthwhile. 4 star because the menu is limited.
Mission is one of my favorite happy hour spots in Philadelphia, and there are a lot of great happy hours so this is a high honor. If you can secure a reservation for HH, do it. I've been known to book tables for random Fridays weeks in advance to ensure I had the option to go if I wanted to.

On my most recent visit, I was able to make a last minute reservation for a Friday at 5 pm. Due to covid protocols, they were enforcing 2 hour table limits.

We scanned the QR code and reviewed the menu online, noting a few new specials. I opted for the Pineapple Chammomile Sangria and it was so good I then opted to have 3 more glasses... it was a Friday!

My friend and I shared a few starters - the Queso and the Esquites. The queso was a very generous portion, far more than we could have finished between the two of us. It was not my favorite of all time, but it was not bad either. The esquites was a definite menu highlight. If you are considering ordering it, just do it. 

On my most recent visit, I was able to make a last minute reservation for a Friday at 5 pm. Due to covid protocols, they were enforcing 2 hour table limits.ted. It's more of a cubed texture. They are still very delicious and I will continue to order them and wish that they were shredded. I loved the cojita cheese on the chicken tacos.

Throughout the entire meal our server was very kind and prompt. The minute there was an empty glass, he appeared! He also gave us the last call before happy hour ended courtesy order, which is always a plus.

I will continue to love Mission and aim to attend as many happy hours there as humanly possible.
The fact I was here for my first 2 times in a span of 3 days says something. Great vibes, great food and great drinks, what more could you want ?

I love the interior decor of this place, very open, modern and welcoming. My favorite thing to order here is the ceviche sampler, I ordered it 2 days in a row! The shrimp and apple one is my favorite, so fresh and flavorful. The snapper and mixto are just as good. 

The tuna tacos here were cooked perfectly with the perfect ratios of all ingredients.

I"m really impressed with this place and can't wait to come back
There are not enough good things I can say about this place. The margaritas, decor, food, service, etc are all on point. This restaurant is so gorgeous that I posted videos on my snapchat and had three friends ask where I was. They couldn't believe I was in Philadelphia! What my friends and I really loved was that the seating was capable of hosting groups of about 2-12. On the side of the bar, a bay window juts out so that if you had a group of about 20, all of your friends could hang in that area. The design of the restaurant is incredibly thoughtful. Paired with the yummy margaritas and happy hour prices, we were smitten. I tried some coconut salsa and was really intrigued. While more like a hummus consistency, this dip was unique and yummy. We all liked it! I am predicting becoming a regular here.
OKURRT!!! Let's talk about Happy Hour, HONEY! 
-Weekdays 5-7pm! Get there right at 5pm, the place fills up FAST!!! 
- The margaritas are nothing to play with! They taste weak but next thing you know you're BLACK OUT BETTY! $6 margs during happy hour and cheap tacos! 

NOW GO DO SOME DAMAGE!!! ;)
Mission Taqueria is the perfect place to come if you are looking to get a boomerang of you and the gals cheering margaritas. Maybe I was just in a good mood because the margs I had were way stronger than I expected, but this was one of the best Mexican spots I've ever been. The flavor combos are inventive and delicious. The ambiance is fun and instaworthy.
Came here on a Monday night thinking it would be dead but it was actually quite busy! There's a lot of space and light, and the restaurant itself is very cute. The tacos come in sets of three and you can't mix and match. There were three of us so we ordered the fried mahi mahi, the beef short rib and the lamb. I thought the mahi mahi was best, followed by the short rib. I wasn't a huge fan of the lamb - I thought it was a bit dry. Would love to come back for their happy hour!
Came here at happy hour on a Friday night; very crowded with young professionals with a good , work is over, and I just got paid atmosphere.  
Tacos were good; had the mahi mahi and the crispy pork; both were tasty and the guacamole was delicious.  They had cucumber chips available as well(sliced cucumber) which was great for the no carb crowd at my table.  
Food was good but there are a lot of rules silly rules here.  We were here at happy hour and at a table so therefore we weren't allowed to have the queso.  Queso is apparently only available at the bar.  IN A MEXICAN RESTAURANT, you CANNOT have queso unless at the bar. Stupid rule. 
I also asked for a double margarita. They come in highball glasses; so let's get a big girl drink. Denied.   Another stupid rule. 
I've never been to a restaurant where they won't let me give you money for food/drinks. 
Again, the food was good but with the crowd and the rules, I wouldn't run back.
As a San Francisco native, this place reminds me nothing of the Mission. While the Mission has gentrified in the last several years, there are still gritty parts, and hole in the walls like El Farolito are thankfully still to be found.  This felt nothing like the Mission or any of its eateries.

With that said, Mission was fantastic.  Servers were flustered and confused at times, but the food and atmosphere made up for that.  The tacos (steak and goat) were fantastic.  Whoever thought about pair goat and berries in a taco is a genius.  Ceviche was great too.  Can't wait to go back.
Move over El Vez, there's a new taco restaurant in town and it provides amazing watermelon margaritas with such an respectable and fun not robotic staff that clearly love their jobs.

I am a firm believer in first impressions are last impressions so to walk in with several smiling managers overlooking the staff, I knew my friends and I were in good hands. I worked in the restaurant business for five years and the main issue always were managers hiding in their office, making the staff settle out disputes or unruly customers -- not here at Mission. 

Now, onto the food, the salsa we had (Fresca) was the perfect marriage of spice and savory, as well as the fresh nachos adding a crunch! I had the mahi mahi tacos, grilled shrimp tacos; and the chicken wings makes me feel some type of way. The glaze on the chicken made me want to stop being a lady and lick the bowl clean which will eventually happen to the horror of other customers.

Tabitha, the server we had was amazing with such a warm personality! Mission did an amazing job with hiring the right people.

I'm making this the only place I get Mexican food from now on and frozen watermelon margaritas as my adult slushie.
This place has great happy hour deals with cheap drinks and yummy tacos. The carnitas tacos and chicken tacos were flavorful. Who can complain about a $2 taco? The watermelon sangria and margaritas were delicious as well. 

This place can get very packed very quickly, so get here early. Our most recent time here, they forgot several items we ordered. The service could use some improvement.
I love the way this restaurant looks, it's fun to be here and it's really modern and clean. There are really cool free taco temp tattoos at the hostess's desk so make sure to grab one on your way in or out.

There's a foosball table in the middle of the restaurant which is fun, and there's a bunch of places to sit, tables, the bar, booths, window seats, etc.

The nachos are a MUST get, with goat chili - who knew how amazing that would be. The tacos are ok I've had better but I've also had worse, the horchata is also hit or miss. I've been here 2 times so far and the first time the horchata was delicious and the second it was kind of gross. Not sure what's up with that.
My friends and I came by to check out this place since we were in the area. 

AMBIENCE/STAFF: The restaurant doesn't have the "feel" of an taco place. It's sort of a hipster/modern verison of a taco place. Great for casual settings, night out for drinks. The staffs were really nice, they provided excellent service.

FOODFORTHOUGHT: The tacos are pricy in comparison to what we usually pay for in New York. It's about $13-15 for three tacos and you can't mix and match you have to get a couple of the sets and swap it with your friends. We ordered the Fried Mahi Mahi taco, grilled skirt steak taco, Nachos and Ceviche. The tacos were mediocre, felt like it was missing something. The Nachos were good, if they had more sauce on top would have tasted really good. The Ceviche was a little to oily. They don't give you salsa so you need to order that if you want to add it onto your tacos. 

Overall, Mission Taqueria isn't a place for authentic tacos. It is overpriced and not worth the price IMO. Salsas and Ceviche are usually free, it was pretty ridiculous to pay for additional stuff that you can get for free at other places.
Mission Taqueria is delightful!
 
When arriving to Mission Taqueria, you'll stroll up the stairs and be greeted with a ray of light from their deck, as well as, cute succulents and greenery hanging all about. their decor just doesn't get any cuter. 

I went to MT for sunday brunch hours and there was plenty of seating. I met up some friends and we had the chips and salsa (habanero, salsa verde and a coconut one) as well as the huevo ranchero, the mushroom tacos, and the kale salad with shrimp. all of the dishes were sooo freakin' good!! They also offer cute aqua fresca, freshly squeezed juice and some really decadent looking cocktails. I'm on a no-alcohol-till-my-vacation kick and went with the hibiscus aqua fresca, but any other time, i'd be all over their drink menu!

By dessert time, I was too full to order more, but next time my partner is in town, we're doing date night here and i'm going throw back a tres leches!
The best spot in the city for happy hour! Love to bring my friends there who are visiting and the margaritas are amazing! I highly recommend this place. P.S. Don't leave without ordering guac!!!
I got referred to mission taqueria from my friend who recently visited Philly. This taco shop totally screams modern hip aesthetics af. I luckily got to dine here during their happy hour on a Friday night and this place was packed. The happy hour wait can get pretty long so try to get here as early as possible. If the happy hour thing ain't your thing or you simply don't want to wait an hour, mission taqueria also has regular dine in tables with their normal menu. 

Their happy hour menu is small, but definitely more affordable and cheap. I tried the two tacos on the happy hour menu and got the "green" juice drink from their normal menu. First off, for EIGHT FRIGGIN DOLLARS, I expected more juice than what I got. Literally half the damn drink was just ice cubes....seriously what a mothereffing RIP OFF. NEVER ORDER THE JUICE HERE...

Now now, I understand most people order drinks during happy hour, but I was getting sick so I figured some juice with ginger should help me...Anyways, onto the food. The tacos are single tortilla and have a decent amount of meat inside. I don't know if I was sick, but I didn't really see  anything THAT amazing with their happy hour tacos. My sister also agreed, but at least they were only $2 each. 

I wish I could try their regular tacos on their regular dine in menu, but their prices are definitely NOT affordable. Cute place and good happy hour deals, but I think I'd only come back for happy hour.
Great vibe. Delicious tacos. Awesome guacamole. It's a really fun atmosphere with a fun rotating artist gallery in the center of it. The waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive. The food is solid albeit a tad bit expensive Mexican food. Their happy hour gives great deals though! I've been there numerous times and tried most of the tacos on the menu-- all are well balanced and filling.
(to the tune of "Body Like a Back Road" by Sam Hunt)

Folks in town, or a hot date? (Gotta blow out your hair)
Head to this Taqueria, hope he pulls out your chair
Looking at the menu - dang, this place costs a lot
But if you're not the one paying, why not visit this spot?

Space inside looks real cute, but the point's kind of moot
I'll only come here during their happy hour
Dropping 40, tastes like twenty; portions aren't too plenty
Tasty stuff but prices got me feeling sour...

Guac alone costs twelve bucks, thought tacos were cheap
Just a few tiny tortillas, stuffed with veggies and meat
Tacos don't come with sides, no, and they're all pretty small
I bet I'd still be hungry if I just ate them all.

Space inside looks real cute, but the point's kind of moot
I'll only come here during their happy hour
Dropping 40, tastes like twenty; portions aren't too plenty
Tasty stuff but prices got me feeling sour...

This is a spot to see and be seen. But honestly, nothing wowed me enough to want to go back and pay full price. There are too many amazing places right in the same area that won't break the bank (we're talking 50 for a not-very-filling dinner for two, without alcohol). Other than the Instagram-friendly decorations, I don't really see the appeal.
This place is so cute!

There seems to be relatively few spots open for when you're looking last minute to go out to eat a nicer dinner at 9:30pm on a Wednesday evening. However, Mission Taqueria pulled through, with its delicious panoply of salsas and unique tacos! The decor is also a tasteful mix of trendy yet relaxed, and they have a wide variety of different seating arrangements (booths, long tables, small tables, window seats, etc). There's also a cute intimate upstairs courtyard/skylight room in the center of the restaurant if you wanna take a break to go outside and look up into the night sky. 

It's just a tad bit pricey for what you get, but hey, it's well worth a trip!
Thought everything was exceptional. 

Good food, music, decoration, service.

The salsa they have are very different and depending on your taste can really like it or hate it. Same goes with the tacos. Loved the fish one.

Tip: Check out the outdoor section in the middle of the restaurant.
Came here on a Tuesday at 6pm and it was super crowded. There were a few tables available for a sit down dinner but the bar was completely full.

Their happy hour is from 5-7p and taco Tuesday is from 5-11p, so we happened to come just in time! We got some house margs to start, which were mostly tart with some mild sweetness, and pretty strong. I'm a little bit of a margarita snob since I like to make them myself but I was pleasantly surprised by these. 

We also ended up getting the taco special (free marg with an order of tacos, $15) with mahi mahi. It had good flavor and pleased my taco loving friend, though could have used a little more sauce.

Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back again for their margs and happy hour specials!
The hype behind Mission Taqueria's decor is all true. This is the space of Instagram/millennial/Pinterest dreams. Although the entrance is slightly hidden and you walk up some narrow stairs, once you enter the restaurant you'll be surprised by its size. It is a large area covered in hanging plants and fun wallpaper. I heard of their monthly TacoLabs so we jumped at June's when it was with Hungry Pigeon.

The drink menu is extensive and incredibly enticing. I settled on a Michelada (with tamarind straw, yum) and my boyfriend got the cucumber melon sangria. Although the michelada was very good, the sangria stole the show. It was refreshing, delicious, and a great complement to the food.

TacoLab is a pre-set menu of about 5-6 dishes and since it was our first time we were worried about leaving hungry. That was a mistake. We were stuffed by the end and left with very happy stomachs. Some highlights were the radish and carrot salad, rueben fish tacos (a great Hungry Pigeon riff on Baja style tacos), and the tres leches cake. We didn't order from the regular menu since this was more than enough food but I fell in love with Mission Taqueria. It's a great choice for any occasion: brunch with a group, drinks before a night out, dinner date, lunch with out of town friends. I was also very impressed by the service we received that night. Water was always refilled and silverware thoughtfully replaced every so often, granted we were in the back next to the server station (not exactly the best spot but also a front row to the cooking line). 

I'm so glad I tried it sooner than later so that I can find other excuses to try more food and drinks!
Everything about this place is so refreshing- the margaritas, the fresh salsas, and the bright open environment.

Mission Taqueria has an airy open feel with big windows bringing in natural light. It is great for for groups with lots of big picnic tables and booths. There's also TVs, foosball and shuffle board so there's plenty to do!

I had the grilled skirt steak tacos, chicken tacos and pork tacos. An order comes with three tacos so they're great to share and taste a few. They were all good but the skirt steak was my favorite by far!  We also tried all 5 of the salsas. I wasn't a huge fan of the pepita and the coconut-hazelnut as hey we're both too sweet for me, but other people in my group enjoyed them. 

As for margaritas their house is good but their frozen watermelon/cucumber/serrano pepper is AMAZING. Seriously, this margarita is perfect. Its sweet and spicy and so refreshing!
Sat at the bar for dinner - bar was less than half full and wasn't greeted for 10 min.  Bartenders not pleasant, no lime garnish in the margarita.

Ordered the ceviche, came with a fork.  Had to request chips to accompany it.

Pastor tacos were cold.  

Way to many good Mexican options in Philly to give this place another shot.
My disclaimer on this review is i did not come here for food so my review is solely on ambiance and service. My friends and I came here for post dinner drinks and we all were saying how we felt like this had a cute outdoor beer garden feel but was a nice change up because instead of beer we could drink some nice cocktails! We liked the picnic table set up and the fact that they had an area set up for games. I will definitely come back for drinks again!
I wanted to like this place so badly! I love Mexican/Tex mex food, and this place is decorated so cute but I left super disappointed. The inside is so fun! They have neon signs and cute little decor pieces all over! 

We started out ordering chips and salsa. You can pick 3 salsas so we chose the Roja, Verde, and habanero. I really liked the habanero and the verde! The habanero was hot, but it wasn't so hot that you needed a gallon of water next to you! The verde was also really good, it was a little tart but really flavorful.

I ordered the carnitas tacos and my husband ordered the chicken tacos. My husband really liked his tacos! But mine were disgusting! My first bite consisted of a large, gelatinous piece of fat that I spit out. Not pleasant, but also not a deal breaker because it happens. Second bite, another nasty rubbery piece of fat that I have to spit out. So at this point I open up the taco and inspect. There were 4 giant chunks of fat in 1 small taco. I was really grossed out and gave up. I wasn't going to ask for a box, but my husband said I should take it home. 

Our waiter never asked how our food was, if he had I would have sent it back which is something I rarely do. I took the leftovers home and left them on the counter (forgot to put in fridge) and my dog ended up swiping them. LOL. I was honestly relieved because I was not going to touch them. I didn't enjoy them, but I'm glad at least my dog did!
This a chill place to grab lunch or drinks with friends. Had a good amount of people for a Saturday afternoon but not too many. The service was courteous and attentive. The shrimp tacos, plantains and guacamole were solid and I would order them again. The waitress informed me that I could have cucumber slices for the guacamole instead of chips. The cost of the tacos is certainly higher relative to other taco/Mexican restaurants although consistent with the neighborhood. My only issue was that the temperature of the tacos were closer to warm (not at all hot). I pointed this out to a staff member and they had no problem putting in a new order.
Ordered the Chicken Milanese Torta, $14 and Oaxacan Express lunch special: Grilled Wild Shrimp tacos + Calabaza Soup + Hibiscus juice, $15

Calabaza Soup is the greatest butternut squash soup I have had thus far. Asian pear pieces in soup that gave texture and sweetness? Amazing. Chile oil made things so much better. Grilled Wild Shrimp taco was alright but not filling. I'd skip the deal that is the Oaxacan Express if you are hungry. 

The Chicken Milanese Torta... Exceeded expectations. My goodness gracious, that sandwich is a monster and just divine. Crispy chicken breast, bean hummus, tomato, avocado, queso oaxaca, watercress, jalapeño mayo = Explosion of flavors. I am happy to say that the Chicken Milanese Torta at Mission Taqueria has replaced Joju (at Queens NYC) as the best chicken sandwich I've had thus far. Also the hot sauce in the bear is delicious. Care to share?

Why is there no Mission Taqueria in NYC? You would do amazing here. I can totally see this place in Brooklyn, that hipster artsy feel.
I popped in here for lunch on a Thursday and left a little unsatisfied.
 
The down side to this place is that they don't do substitutions. I wanted to get their "express" special but it came with soup (it was about 90+ degrees outside and preferred to not amp up the heat) sadly, I wasn't able to switch it out. Which is a little off putting because I don't see a big deal in switching out soup for a salad but I'm just a consumer...

Another downside to their ordering process are their taco orders.

The order itself comes in 3 and being a first timer, I definitely wanted to try a variety of different tacos. But again, I wasn't able to make any changes or substitutions so I asked the waitress what her opinion was; she suggested the Grilled Shrimp tacos and that's what I went with.

Personally, when I hear the word "grilled"- I'm imagining fresh veggies and/or poultry thrown onto a fire grill for a short period of time to get a good char flavor.

This was not the case with the shrimp tacos. Not only was there an excess amount of oil on the shrimp but all that oil made the tortillas soggy and caused for a very sloppy meal.

There were some upsides to my meal- the tacos came with a side of sweet potatoes which were delightful. They were perfectly cooked and extremely tasty. The tacos also had some really great picked onions on top- which I am a sucker for.

All in all, I'd probably only give Mission another chance for happy hour, the vibe is great and their cocktails are delicious.
First came here for the boozy YEE brunch the week before the Eagles won the Superbowl and have been meaning to return since the food and drinks were bomb.  I finally made it back here last Friday night for a late (8ish) dinner and it was still BOMB.

Came with no reservations hoping to wing it (don't do this) and the wait was about 45 minutes for a table for 2 which we were willing to do but thankfully 2 spots opened at the bar and we snagged them fast.  Basically, definitely make a reservation as this place was poppin'.  I could feel the crowd every now and then at my back at the bar where I was sitting but I didn't care cause I had high hopes everything would be as good as it was the last time I was here.  And it DEFF did not disappoint!

We each got several rounds of the Green Juice margarita and it still slapped as hard as the previous time.  I'm not into switching up my margs from classic all too often, but you gotta try this.  I don't even like healthy green juice, per se, and this was loaded with shit like kale and spinach and who knows what else but I promise you, they craft it so expertly, you'll take a sip and realize how refreshing and strong and amazing it really is!

We started with the chips and guac and each got two tacos (2 shortrib asado, 1 lamb belly and 1 roasted cauliflower).  I was skeptical two tacos each wouldn't be enough cause I remembered they were on the smaller side, but thank god we did cause that helping of guac was MASSIVE.  Chips were mad fresh and crunchy and guac was super flavorful, probably one of the better ones I've had in recent past.  The tacos were DOPE.  Each were so unique in flavor and topping combination and cooked perfectly.  However, by far the absolute best was the lamb belly.  AMAZING.  I would go back and just order 3 of those.  

It's a little on the higher end in price, but 100% worth it (plus the ambience inside is really impressive).  Bartenders were ON POINT for the crowds and super accommodating.  Food came out fast and hot.  Will definitely be back (hopefully in the day time when the sunshine filters through that gorgeous atrium and bay windows)!
So I've been dying to try this place for a while but every time I come it's just too packed. I was very glad to have a friend down for HH and that could come a little earlier before it got to crowded! We sat in the beer garden area, which is super adorable. It's all inside but they have these awesome sunlights with hanging plants that give it an outdoor vibe. They've also got this psuedo outdoor patio area that makes it look like a human terrarium but it's still a cool vibe nonetheless. 

I had the hibiscus sangria to drink, which was great! A little strong, but the less drinks I have to buy the better. It wasn't a normal sangria taste, which I loved because sometimes sangria just isn't the best. If I didn't have work to come home and do I would have had at least one more of those drinks! My friend and I split the guacamole and the empanadas. The guac was a HUGE serving and came with tortilla chips. I loved that it was mostly avocado and none of that filler tomato and onions BS. Definitely worth the price tag. The empanadas had plaintains in them and while I was skeptical at first, I really liked it! I would order again. The happy hour menu had a few bites on deck but we stuck to the regular menu to order our snacks and honestly it wasn't a fortune like I was expecting it to be! I would definitely come for happy hour again - I liked that there were a lot of people but it wasn't wall to wall I can't move and you're making me uncomfortable with how close you're standing.
I'm in Philadelphia for work for a couple of days and looked to Yelp for a place to try out for dinner. I settled on Mission Taqueria because of the great reviews and because, well, tacos. 

Small menu, but everything sounded great. Settled on Grilled Shrimp Tacos (you get 3). They were loaded with three huge seasoned shrimp(s??), and I think it was pickled red onions and jalapeño slivers all on a corn tortilla. They were very good! I sort of wish there was a cool sauce topping it all, but that is 100% personal taste- they were great as is!  I also got a side of fried plantains, which were excellent and cooked perfectly. 

The decor was really unique for a taco joint. All white washed wood and gray colors with pops of color in the chairs, accent wall and greenery. 

It was a little pricey, but I the location is right downtown, so I wasn't surprised at all. I do wish that you could mix and match tacos so you could try a few different ones-I've been spoiled by Bakersfield.
Few things make me happier than finding a good taqueria. During a recent day trip to Philly I had a chance to check out the Philadelphia Museum of Art (which is beautiful by the way) but after touring the whole museum my girlfriend and I were hungry and had tacos on the brain. On a whim, we decided to check out Mission Taqueria in Center City.

On the weekends, they have a midday menu from 3-4:30 which worked to our benefit. The menu was smaller than normal so it was easier to choose what to order.


We started with a round of drinks from their cocktail menu. They were both refreshing and perfectly hit the spot.

We started with an order of Chips and Guac, because nothing pairs better with cocktails than that. The chips were crispy and the guac was creamy and packed with flavor. We demolished this bowl of chips.

We also split an order of the Empanadas. There really aren't too many places to get an empanada in Baltimore so whenever I order them, it's a real treat. These were filled with grilled plantains, poblano peppers, and Oaxaca cheese. Even better, it was served with a crema for dipping and we could not get enough. There was serious contemplation about if we should place a second order.

The real reason we came to Mission was for the Tacos. There were only three types on the midday menu so we opted to get one of each. Between the carnitas, chicken in mole negro, and fried mahi mahi - my favorite was the fish taco. It came with jalapeno mayo, pickled cabbage, and a slice of avocado. Even though it was fried, it tasted super fresh.
This place is fantastic! Located above the Oyster House. There is an unassuming stair case off the sidewalk that will lead you up into the taco nest, it's like a secret passageway. Once you reach the top of the stairs you'll see a sanctuary skylight room filled with plants and a green chaise lounge. They did a great job decorating this place. The atmosphere is fun and the food is excellent. I first went with a friend for lunch in early September, and we both had an excellent meal. She had the shrimp tacos and I had the shrimp salad, we shared guac to start. The owner Daniel visited our table to see how we were getting on, he was cheery and genuinely interested in what we though of the place and how our meal was. 2 thumbs up! A week later we had my daughter's birthday party dinner there, the girls got their own table, loved the food then played for a 1/2 hour at the giant foosball table. The waiters were very attentive. Highly recommend for couples, date night, and kids too. Great place, we will be back soon!!
Mission is my go-to happy hour spot. Actually, even if it's not happy hour! They always have a special frozen margarita. Every single one I have tried has been amazing! The frozen margaritas are not a happy hour special, but worth the full price. Their house Margie's are delicious too, especially the spicy ones! I'm pretty sure I have also had just about every taco they offer and haven't had a bad one yet. As an added bonus, service is quick!
If you want to experience a Miami like vibe in the middle of Philly winter, this is the place to be. I walked in here during a very sunny weekend I. Philadelphia and was immediately taken by the ambience of this place. It was like I was on a vacation in a beach town with vibe that Mission Tacqueria has. 

There is plenty of seating available including some at the kitchen bar where you can see the chefs making delicious tacos and other Mexican delights.

We reached later in the afternoon and had to select from the limited menu which had all their top picks. The margaritas are awesome and the guacamole was so refreshing. We also tried the tacos - chicken, Carnitas and fish, and they were all nice but I have had better tacos that cost much less..

Overall a great hang out place in center city Philly.
OoOoOoOo come here for happy hour. Limited cocktail selections but the sangria was pretty good. Also chow down on some tacos and wings. Gets packed shortly after happy hour begins on a weekday, so plan accordingly!
Terrible service!!
We were a large group with a reservation.  We were  seated on time, however our waitress took our order and never checked on us after.  She would deliver our food, and walk away. We had to ask for water numerous times.  There were 12 of us and we were only given 2 small bottles of water to begin with.
The food was delivered to the table with all of the same kinds of tacos on the same plate, which was very hectic since we had a long table and food had to be passed around.  
Near the end of our meal we realized we did not receive 2 tacos that had been ordered, however we had two extra tacos.  We flagged down our waitress and informed her of the mistake.  She took the extra tacos from our table and threw them in the trash!!!!   This blows my mind and is the reason for the review!  
I've been visiting Philly for the last few days and this restaurant's service was the worst service I've had in the city!!
The food here is definitely not the most authentic Mexican food but I would call it more bougie, American-Mexican food. The tortillas are made by hand in the kitchen and freshly cooked but overall, the flavors and menu options are not super authentic. I definitely love coming here and have visited multiple times for happy hour or birthday dinners. This place is usually packed and you may have to wait 30 min-1 hour to be seated so order a drink and appetizer to hold you over and play some shuffle board with the other customers waiting for a table! The happy hour menu is good and definitely my favorite option when I do visit Mission. 

The drinks are good and strong enough and I really recommend to try the spicy margaritas or the cucumber margaritas if they're still on the menu. I would definitely come back to visit and get more of their tasty tacos, guac and chips and margaritas! View my pictures to see what the food is like and my ratings!
An awesome (not authentic) Mexican spot in philly. Perfect for when you're craving a fun margarita and chips and salsa. The bar menu can't be beat as they take tequila to classic cocktails and make unique house blend mixes. My favorite is the green juice margarita- house made green juice and tequila. Basically healthy! 

Best part of this place is the atmosphere. Great for a group or a date. Equipped with games, a courtyard and lots of space. 

The small plates are all delicious, can't go wrong no matter what you order. 

Stand out dishes:
Street corn- very user friendly, they cut it off the cob! 
Salsa trio
Any civiche
One of my favorite places to go for lunch. Everyone is super nice. Quick service, but it does get super busy. My go to is tortilla Soup:
Came here for restaurant week: chips and salsa, ceviche, mole chicken tacos, and chocolate flan. Overall, the service was probably the best that I have gotten here at any restaurant in Philadelphia. I could best describe the food as upscale Mexican food. If you're expecting street tacos, you're gonna be disappointed. Fooseball tables and large picnic tables all around the dining room. Very fun atmosphere, though expensive for the amount of food you get. Probably won't be back because of the prices.
I'm so glad me and a co-worker decided to go here for lunch. It was everything I imagined and more. 

1. The best-decorated place I've been in Philly. Modern designs, dainty decor with such a refreshing look.

2. The food was absolutely delicious. I'm also someone who would complain that these Mexican joints skimp out on their food and Mission Taqueria didn't let me down! Keep in mind I went for lunch and they offer an awesome lunch combo!! ($15 for an aqua fresco, a soup, and 3 tacos) What a steal for center city!

3. Let's get down to the food and drinks: Let's just say there I am sitting with my co-worker 1 house marg, an aqua fresco, and a water. 3 drinks for one person ( which is great so I don't have to keep bugging the waiter for a refill). So to start off, you don't understand how serious I am when I say I wish I could buy the tortilla soup by the gallon. My god Chili's has NOTHING on this tortilla soup. I ordered the pork tacos and my only complaint was it was a BIT spicy for me and I had no idea that they were going to come with such a kick. I'm not one who can handle spicy so I wish there was like a lil' jalapeno pepper on the menu to inform me. I still ate them anyway because the flavor was delish and I mean I did have 3 drinks near me so I was a-ok.

4. The service was fantastic. Our waiter was very professional who gave great recommendations. He even made me wanna switch the drink I ordered so he kindly swapped it out for me with the one he recommended! What a guy!

Grab a bunch of your co-works, your gal pals or your significant other, make some memories, soak in the atmosphere and inhale the food. You won't be disappointed.
