I'm hopelessly addicted to Han's cooking. His Sichuan is always a dependable standby, and I'm glad this restaurant is an option in Manayunk.

Last I was here, I brought a large crew and we went for the tasting menu. It was an assault of the senses: the smells and tastes and textures of Dan Dan noodles, dumplings, soups, and a medley of other dishes blurred through my mind.

Be prepared for spiciness, or ask to tone it down a little. Their tasting menu is a boot camp of hot peppery goodness in your face. Dishes rated at "10" make even this tin man cry.
I came here one weekend with my twin sons, Bradley and Bryan. Their mom (my ex-wife Cynthia) and I recently got divorced and I moved into an apartment in Manayunk. They live in Glenside in a twin -- it's not that far away but I'm only entitled to see them one weekend a month. This as my first weekend with the kids.

At first I wanted full custody. After all, I'm an actuary and in a management position so I make a decent amount of money. But money isn't everything. My sons need a father. I admittedly wasn't there for them. And it was because of my fear of fatherhood. My father was a wonderful man (and taught me everything I know about being an actuary, although I thought maybe I wanted to become a writer) and never thought I'd be as good a father as him.

I took B&B there because they LOVE Chinese food -- used to love getting some General Tso's with them and playing Monopoly, before work got in the way. It was tense at first -- the kids weren't really talking about their new school. Bryan then started calling me a jerk and telling me to shut up and then screamed out "YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!" before going to hide in the bathroom. Thankfully, the hostess (older Chinese lady) helped get him out of there! 

This is going to be a rough transition. It took the end of a 14-year marriage to really appreciate my wife and my family. There's a lot of pain on both sides (I know Cynthia's upset even though I saw her profile on OK Cupid and even sent her a message LOL). 

Anyways, Han Dynasty lives up to the reputation. We got some family style food -- I got the Dan Dan noodles at a 4 because Bradley hates spicy food and it was pretty hot. We also got the cucumber and cumin style pork -- all at a 4 and DELICIOUS!

I would recommend Han Dynasty to anyone who is in the Manayunk area who has their kids for the first weekend after the end of your 14-year marriage and is having a hard time communicating with your twin sons and finding it difficult to live up to your father's lasting imprint.
Bar none, the best Chinese food I've had, anywhere, ever.

I'm not even kidding. If I wanted to start this review with a joke, It'd go something like this:

Me: Knock knock.
You: Who's there?
Me: Gimme.
You: Gimme, who?
Me: Gimme all your money because this is a robbery and I needs it for my dry fried beef!
You: Ow, my liver!
Me: *flees the scene a la Cops*

You see that? This grub is almost good enough to induce murderous food lust. I say almost, because I took out the poison from my jacket (I always carry a little with me) and strongly considered applying it to each of my dinner companions to maximize the amount of food I was getting. I didn't... THIS time...

We did a whole ton of courses as a tasting menu organized by Dave H. Here's what I remember:

1) Cucumbers in chili oil - the name does not do these little guys justice. You have to have these. They're an odd mix of cold and hot, but it works.

2) Tripe in chili oil - I hate tripe. I LOVE Han's take on it. I was actually able to bite through it.

3) Cold sesame soy noodles - Semi sweet and vaguely nutty thanks to the sesame seed oil. A good contrast for the spicier things that we had.

4) Dumplings in chili oil - This was the hottest thing I remember that night. Not the spiciest thing I've ever tasted anywhere, but it packed a punch.

5) Dan dan noodles - With such a ridiculous name, it's easy to see how I was initially skeptical of them. I mean, I could practically hear the little oriental flute from Carl Douglas' "Kung Fu Fighting" going on in the background as I ate it. Still, this was probably one of the best things I had all night. Believe the hype, because these guys straddle that line between junky comfort food and quality cuisine that won't require you to spend the next 24 hours on a toilet seat.

6) Dry fried beef - Da bomb. Get this. NOW!

7) Cumin pork - my least favorite, but still pretty good.

8) Fish soup - standard hot/slightly sour soup with some kinda light-meat fish in it. I'm not so good at identifying fish meat. It was tasty.

9) Mapo tofu - I hate tofu. I liked mapo tofu. Spicy and pungent.

10) Salt-battered shrimp - very very salty. Not my taste, but maybe it was because I'd been eating a bunch of really hot things before that. You might like it, if you like salt battered squid.

11) Shredded chicken with crispy rice - This was surprisingly sweet and light. Very good as a contrast to the spicier dishes.

12) Some other stuff I'm sure I'm forgetting. Try it all!

This is the kind of food they write songs about. One of these days, Chef Han will not be remembered as he should - for saving us all from the combined robot/zombie apocalypse (Robozompocalypse 2020!) - but rather for his spicy dan dan noodles.

The Manayunk space is very well laid out - the dining room is more square than rectangle, so that means no fumbling your way around other diners trying to get to the rest room. Also, it's great for big groups, and is, at least since I last visited, still a BYO. 

On a final note, I met Han, and he was a really cool guy. I told him I'd be back with Dave sometime to sample his face-meltingest, sperm-killingist, spicy dish. I'm excited.

Pro-tip:
Bring friends to share with - everyone order a different thing, and have them all split family style. TOTALLY worth it.
This is my 3rd review of Han Dynasty, seeing I have been to the Cherry Hill location along with my personal favorite in Old City. I am happy to see there is a Han located here in the 'Yunk,(Manayunk)  which could be a bad thing. Bad in meaning "good" mind you, because when I need that Dan Dan fix I can just swoop on in.  

Great dishes coming out of this spot off of Main St. I consider this the training location to get your taste buds acclimated to Han's style of heat. Heat as in the spice levels of your dish. I personally think the Old City location is the "Mecca" of all things spicy. That is where you'll be sweating like you've just been in a sauna. Manayunk , I am not knocking you, but your dishes could be hotter. Like I said, this is the training course, and as you experience his other locations you'll notice the difference.  I would say out of 10 on the heat factor they are a 4, maybe 5 .  Hey it is still a great  way to clear up any sinus issues you are experiencing. 

The menu is all the same, the Dan Dan is still delicious, those spicy cucumbers are always top notch, along with those sesame dumplings, and so forth.  Yes you still will get a good sweat,  while licking your lips trying to alleviate the heat you're enduring.  

Great spot, with a good amount of space and the servers are always on point. Another thing is this is a byob location, so come prepared (if you want) when you enjoy any of these dishes. 

Review over, now order the pork bellies with garlic, or even their dry pot,  you'll enjoy it !
Dinner 
5 women, 5 bottles of wine, 5 Apps and 5 entrees all shared on a Friday night. 
Our server, whose name is forgotten was fabulous! It was his first night and he was absolute perfection so if he or other staff read this: Thank you. 

This location was a big room set with wooden tables. Our reserved table wound up being the one in the back on the right that was snuggly shoved into an alcove with the serving area at our backs on one side and a wall on the other.Hard for tall people who were always hitting their legs on table legs. That was a little disappointing because we did have reservations and the table configurations could have been made to give us with a little more space. That's the only negative.

Again, 5 bottles of wine!  This is a BYO so go ahead, bring your favorite.
Did we try the infamous Dan Dan Noodles?     Absolutely and we loved them.
Did I get 2 suburbanites to try pork belly and they love it  ?.      Heck Yea ! 

I wish I could remember exactly what we ordered but again those 5 bottles of wine impacted my memory. Just know that with every appetizer we tried there were "YUMS" emanating from our mouths. Onto the entrees...Amazing doesn't seem accurate enough. Fresh ingredients, innovatively prepared, presented well.  We had a culinary feast that will be remembered for sometime to come.        And we will be back
I used to like this place until last night. The absolute most horrible dining experience I've ever had:

- Reserved a table for a party of 8 for a friend's birthday party, they lost the reservation and refused to give us the big round table. Instead they pushed three tables together.

- One member of our party was not provided a chair, plate or silverware for over twenty minutes and was forced to stand at the side of our table until we were finally able to flag down an employee.

- We were not greeted by a server for another thirty minutes and frankly I'm still not sure who our actual designated server was supposed to be.

- Twice I had to flag down an employee to clear our dirty plates out of the way. 

THIS IS WHEN IT GOT WEIRD

- Despite the atrocious service, we paid our bill and still tipped over 20% because we're generally just generous tippers and most of us there have worked in the industry at some point... it's a BYOB and we had open bottles of wine we were finishing when the owner RUDELY told us we had to leave because there were people waiting for tables. We hadn't even been there for two hours! We refused to get up until we were finished and the owner cursed at us, told us we had to "get the fuck out", and called the police. His exact words were "I can't handle complaints." Instead of leaving, we waited for the police and when they got there we explained the situation. Since we did nothing wrong and paid our bill, the police stood there and let us finish our wine. 

- They told the owner that if he was going to kick his customers out for no reason there needed to be a sign posted saying that we were obligated to leave immediately when the meal is over. The owner hand wrote a sign on a piece of paper and taped it to the wall above our table.

- We finished our wine and left, and will NEVER eat from this establishment again. They have absolutely no appreciation or respect for their customers and do not deserve our business.
I have been to both the Old City Han Dynasty and the Manayunk Han Dynasty, and can say that I have had great experience at both!  This review is for the Manayunk location only, but either will provide you with amazing food.  The two main differences would be that the Manayunk location is BYOB while the Old City location is not, however the Old City location is much larger, and has much better atmosphere.  

Pros: 
The dishes are served family style so you get try a lot of different things, and you should because everything is great here! The portions are even larger than you expect them to be, so share and share alike. 
The food is different, flavorful and high quality.  Don't miss the dan dan noodles, the spicy cucumbers, anything in the garlic sauce, or the double cooked style fish (the fish was the favorite dish, so crispy and full of flavor).  
The temperature levels are great - they tell you how hot something is, they also let you adjust the spice level if you're not a fan of heat. 
I've always had very good service! 
It is incredibly affordable!! 
BYOB! 

Cons: 
Not too many, the Manayunk one was very crowded on Saturday night.  
The manager, was somewhat pushy, at 9:00 we were told we needed to leave because the next reservation had been waiting for our table? (in reality we had been waiting for our check for about 15 minutes).  While we were paying he was vigorously clearing out table and all but took the beer out of my friends hand. 
Very small space, and not much in atmosphere compared to the Old City location.  

All in all definitely a place you shouldn't miss,and don't be afraid to ask your server for recommendations, everything is great!
Don't drink the free tea - it's shitty.  I didn't say it, Han did.

For about $15 I split 3 vegetarian dishes with a coworker & ordered a pot of quality green tea for a nice long lunch*.  Not bad considering we had leftovers.  Per Blake's Old City review, dan dan noodles can be ordered sans-meat.  We also got the spicy cucumbers - mildly sweet, spicy & so crisp! - and the long hot pepper dish with flavorful braised tofu.  All of the dishes were freshly prepared, full of flavor & had a good kick (not face melting or mouth numbing, but enjoyably spicy).

I'd order the long hot style tofu again in a heartbeat - bonus points for being one of the healthier dishes on the menu.  Also loved & appreciated the frank recommendations & tips while dining.  

Fret not, $25 tasting dinners will start up on select Mondays in the upcoming months.  Or if you can't wait until then, organize a party of 10 for a private tasting dinner.  

*Lunch prices aren't published online or on the menu, but smaller portions are available for less than the listed entree price.
Han Dynasty has been on my list to try for months. On a trip to Manayunk, when I spotted the newly soft-opened location on Main Street, I was stoked. I convinced my husband to try it with me with the phrase "It's so hot on the Yelp boards." That's all it took.

The waiter explained that the restaurant was family style which meant food came out when it was hot. Being a fairly hungry girl, I was thrilled that our food would come out more quickly with this system.

First out was the eggplant in garlic sauce which was rated at a "3" for heat, out of 10. The chinese eggplant was slathered in a spicy red sauce and served piping hot. The brown rice I requested was a bit on the crusty side. Perhaps it would have been better to go with the empty carbs and order the white. Next out was the bok choy with black mushrooms. I've never had mushrooms with such an amazingly chewy texture. The bok choy was cooked perfectly and the sauce was fairly mellow for both heat and heaviness. I would recommend both dishes.

A man who I'm pretty certain was the owner, Han, greeted us warmly and taught us some Chinese words on our way out of the restaurant. Because we were eating at such an odd hour, 3PM which is neither lunch nor dinner, we got to see the cooks come out and eat their meal as we were leaving. There was a lot of soup on their table, so I'm determined to try that out next time we go.
I need to start out by saying that I love Han Dynasty in Old City so I was totally taken aback at how different the service was at this location.  Since I was the friend that Lauren B mentioned in her review, I won't go into too much depth in mine since you can just read hers, but I'll sum up our experience below.

From the moment we walked in, I felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by being there.  Our waitress just made it more obvious by chiding us every step of the way, from telling us what we should order (even though we all knew exactly what we wanted) to giving us lip for finishing or not finishing something.  Top it off with the fact that they didn't give us all the leftovers and I was fed up.  

To make the experience even worse, the dan dan noodles made me queasy for the rest of the night.  I think they had added way more chili oil than Old City does and the oil was just making my stomach turn all night.  (I feel I should mention that whenever we go to the other location, the dan dan is my standard order and it has never made me feel sick before.)  I think I'll stick with the Old City location.
Soft Opening and still nearly a top score.  Dan Dan noodles, um.

Apparently, there is a grand opening in the works (2 to 3 months after some build out) for this BYOB on Main Street.  I can't wait to check back in!
I feel like I throw around good reviews like wedding-goers - sometimes passive aggressively - throw rice at the bride and groom. But regardless of my recent track record, it would be unfair to dock Han a star simply because I've been impressed with the culinary options in Philadelphia. 

Truth be told, we Americans are inundated with decent - but far from superior - global cuisine. The British have their curry, the Texans their Mexican, Hungarians their wienerschnitzel. But here in the cosmopolitan cities of the US, we float from one world fare to the next without thinking, without even tasting, if some recent dietary statistics are to be trusted. 

Han Dynasty is great for two essential reasons. The first is portion control. This is a restaurant that encourages family-style eating, sharing big portions of lo mein or spicy chicken entrees. Secondly, the quality of the food is every bit as controlled as its portions. I've eaten here three times or more, and I've never come across questionable meat - whether undercooked or underprepared. The cuts are thin, the sauces balanced, and the meals impressive. 

Han Dynasty is among the best in its class, if not the best. If you're looking for Asian food in Philadelphia, you won't be disappointed with Han. If you approach it as the family-style meal its intended to be, you'll save on the pounds and dollars. A great date place - especially with the BYOB encouraged. Enjoy!
I had been here once before maybe about 6 months ago and stopped in again recently as the boyfriend had been wanting to try this place.

For me, the food is a solid 4 stars. There is quite the variety in dishes and spice levels to meet everyone's tastes I believe. Really love the spicy cucumber appetizer. Wontons in chili oil were great, I could've eaten that sauce with the spoon! Had the dan dan noodles as usual and double cooked style with pork belly. The pork belly was delicious! I liked the amount of heat that was packed in that Level 4!

While I don't remember much from the service aspect my first visit, the more recent one... the service was a bit off to say the least. Before and after we had our food, we had other servers try to drop off other tables' meals multiple times. After they would ask us if it was ours, we would say no, and then they'd walk to the next table asking the same thing, and over and over until they found the right table. This happened at least 3 times. We were about ready to say yes and just get some free food out of the annoyance :) We commented that they must really not have their stuff together, especially because it was not busy when we were there. And then our server flat out disappeared and we had to flag someone else down to ask for our check. The place is very open and you can see all the tables, so not sure where the server went, but we were waiting for a good while after being finished until when we had to find someone else to get our bill.
We stopped in on our way home from a work trip and after another local place had no highchairs at all. I'm so happy we ended up here as the food was delicious, all the dishes had an amazing taste, and NO fried food!! Service was wonderful and the owner came over to see if we were enjoying our meal and if there was anything he could get us.

This restaurant has won many awards from Zagat to CNN and is worth checking out.

We had:
~pork dumplings in chili sauce, 
~Dry Pot Style with chicken (HOT), served in a sizzling mini wok and cooked in a spicy hot pot sauce with black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, and Sichuan peppercorns. 
~Garlic Sauce Style with shrimp (though the waitress said Tofu was her fav, my husband overrulled), "Sweet, sour, and spicy." Stir fried with ginger, garlic, bamboo, wood ear mushrooms, and bell peppers. 
~String Beans w/ Minced Pork - OMG amazing - fav by far very bacon-y and delicous without being too greasy or heavy.
Han: Everything okay? Do you need more water?
Me: No, thank you, I'm alright.
H: Are you sure? You really look like you need more water (as he fills the glass anyway)
M: I guess I could take a splash...
Alexandra: Why, because he's sweating?
H: Yes. (looks at my empty plate and the almost empty dry fry pork dish) Did you eat those peppers? You don't eat the peppers, they're just for flavor.
M: Oh. Oops...
No need to type up their extensive laughter or ensuing ribbing at my expense.

The food is just as good here as the Chestnut street location, though I think I enjoyed it much more because it's approximately 3 to 7 minutes from my house, which meant I was able to lay on my floor with pants undone to digest my overeating all the more quickly.

Obviously the meal contained Dan Dan, but I should have ordered two because there's never any left over of that for bringing home. Entrees included the dry fry pork I mentioned earlier, which tastes like crispy bacon in hot wing sauce (the goodly spicy and oily kind, not the overly buttery ish), and some very good and mildly sweet crispy rice chicken, which I liked, but also helped my figure out that I tend to only want heat when I eat (it has none by design); came very sauced up, and the bamboo and shrooms were my favorite non-chicken part in order of appreciation, but the rice cakes soaking up the gooey goodness were a novel treat as well. 

With only two of us dining, the three dishes we got had plenty remaing for a repeat at lunch the next day (if I hadn't inhaled the rest at about 2AM, that is), so don't go overboard on th ordering unless you, like us, want that. Also, this is a bit of a smaller venue than the Old City local, so RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST, but the large open air dinning room of this huge windowed BYOB gave it an intimate yet not crowded feel that I very much enjoyed.

Final conclusion- I never have to go to 2nd street for Sichuan again. Also, Han's awesome, but now I know Mama Han is just as rockin'.

*Update*
Tried the Pork fried rice from the kid/baby adult menu to see if Han rocked the generic Chinese food as well as he does his own stuff, but, since I actually like spice, I asked to have it heated up to Dan Dan levels. The meal was uneventful, though I suppose that is intentional, but it was still better than most places dish out. Heat was negligible, so on the slim chance I order it again I will ask them to double the Dan Dan spice. For those who find this pertinent (I certainly do), the Dynasty includes peas and carrots in their Pork Fried Rice, the latter coming al dente.
A lot of people rave about Han Dynasty. I'm not a huge fan. It's more authentic Chinese then say general tso chicken and I really like that you can pick the spice level. However the fold I had was very greasy   

I just wasn't that into it
I still dream of the Dan Dan noodles. they were simply amazing. After eating at Han Dynasty, i dont know that i'll ever be able to eat regular chinese food again. My gf and i went on a Friday evening and basically had the restaurant all to ourselves. The staff was very courteous and dealt with our slow pace. I love the fact that this place is a BYOB, as there really aren't too many on Main St. This place is also ridiculously affordable! 
Some notable dishes : Dumplings in chili oil were very tasty. The spicy cucumbers were amazing! and the right amount of spicy too. Dry pot style with beef was good, and was nice and spicy too. Garlic sauce style with chicken was also delish, but be prepared to taste garlic for the next week!
Best chinese in Manayunk, hands down. Go there now!
This is literally the best chain Chinese restaurant I've ever been too. I recently brought my best friend here (who is Chinese and probably the pickiest eater I know when it comes to Chinese food...), and he approved, which was crazy. 

Dan Dan noodles are one of my favorite all-time dishes now. The spicy fish broth pot is similar to a hot-pot/boiled beef type dish, and I LOVE IT. The fact the food here actually has a nice amount of sichuan peppercorn in it always impresses me; outside of some Chinatown spots I've found around various cities it's one of only places that actually cooks with this amazing spice. 

This is definitely the best legit-ish Chinese spot in area. Be prepared though: if you are expecting General Tso chicken type food this is probably not for you.
HAN(ey) Chile: If you haven't grubbed at one of Han Dynasty's multiple Philly-area locations, you just stay hungry. 

So far, I've only partaken of lunch at the Manayunk location (with co-workers one time, with friends on another). My one co-worker pitched it as "authentic" Chinese cuisine. I wasn't sure what he meant by that--couldn't tell if it was high-brow hoity toity or an honest assessment--but either way I like my Chinese food locations without "pizza rolls" on their menus, so I was delighted.

Sidenote: I mean, really, though. What the heyel is a pizza roll doin' on a Chinese food menu? What is IN IT?! I digress ...

Well I'm here to tell ya consumers of Chinese cuisine, this place is authentically delicious. If Oprah ate it, she'd say this food is bein' its best self, living its true higher calling on purpose-driven plates.

For the record, I think "authentic" was referring to the Sichuan style. Now I'm not a bonafide, proper-word-using foodie--I just write what my gut tells me--but my take on Sichuan means that it's food which is as flavorful as it is spicy. In fact the items on the menu all have numbers in parentheses signifying the range of hotness from 1 to 10. You have to search really hard to find anything with the (1) on it, so be prepared for the flavor-kick infusion that's about to overtake your palate.

You should start with the Dan Dan Noodles. You should not eat at this establishment and not try these (unless you're vegetarian/don't eat pork).

You should also approach the whole dining experience family style so you can ingest a maximum array of awesome--from Cumin Style chicken (6) to Garlic Sauce Style shrimp (3) to Hot Sauce Style pork (7).

The servers start you off with a glass of water and some green tea. This establishment is BYOB. As you may have surmised from some of the other reviews, that bottle may need to be a water one (in addition to the vino). This leads me to talk a wee bit about the servers and service.

Personally, while I noticed a bit of a language barrier when communicating with my server, it didn't bother me; if anything it added to the "authentic" ambiance, and remember people--smiling goes a long way when relating to someone. When my server said hot, I said how hot, he said hot again and I used my eyebrows and open mouth to ask, "Like crazy hot?" ... with a smile. When he smiled back, I went and located a dish that had a (3) next to it ... because I exercise common sense whenever possible.

Granted, the servers are not water boys. They may, in fact, treat constantly refilling your water glass the way a 15-year-old treats their parents, so ask for a water pitcher and watch them place a carafe on your table. Smile and say thank you.

This is 5-star food without the 5-star catering to your every whim. These servers haven't been schooled in America's "the customer is always right" mantra and that's okay because your money is paying for food that is piping hot, of good quality, flavorful and delicious.
So I met this dude who told me that Han Dynasty wasn't awesome. I heard his arguments about it being "too spicy" and how he wanted something more "like regular Chinese." He also told me to "stop hurting him" and that he had a "wife and child" later on in the conversation. I'm not sure. I couldn't hear him with the pounding of my own heartbeat in my ears. I also couldn't see him, as my vision had gone completely crimson.

Oh. 

Well.
Ahem.

Han Dynasty is fucking awesome. If you're a fan of the Old City location, you'll be a fan of this location. There are subtle changes in the food compared to the old city location(for example, the spicy cucumbers in chili oil are a little bit more garlicky here(better) and the three cup chicken is cut into larger pieces(worse) but all of this is nitpicking. This is still Han Dynasty and it still rules.

Get the Dan Dan noodles for the love of all that is holy.

After my first time at this location, I wrote a song about it - 
http://bradpodraymusic.com/handynasty.cfm
The Manayunk location is not good compared to the other locations. I have gone to the Philadelphia and Royersford locations frequently for the dan Dan noodles, dumplings in chili oil, and sesame noodles.  I would always try other items too but my favs were consistently good until I went to the manayunk location on 12/26/15. Very little spice and Lots of GARLIC on everything - so strong the uber drive had to open the windows on the way home- caused for a disappointing night. The food all had the same garlic sauce and tasted nothing like it does in the other locations. The soup was decent and the service was fast so I'll give it a 2 star. 4/5stars at the other locations- just not here.
This just made the short list of my favorite Chinese restaurants. I was here tonight with a vegetarian colleague and on the waiter's suggestion, we ordered: 

* Dan dan noodles
* Cold sesame noodles
* Fish, double cooked style
* Eggplant with garlic sauce

Everything was so good! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.
After reading dynamite Yelp reviews I had to check this location out. I am baffled about my experience! Maybe it is because I eat vegetarian, but the food was just not good... at all. We got the vegetarian Dan Dan noodles, the scallion pancakes and the hot tofu. The noodles were crazy bland, the pancakes drenched in oil, and the hot tofu had spot on spice (we asked for a 10 spice level) but the flavor was just not appetizing, there was something strange about it that made me not want to take another bite - I know it had those Japanese peppercorns in it, but I've had them before and enjoyed them. Also, the service was pretty bad, we didn't get knives and we had one napkin between us. I guess I'd give it another try because everyone's so crazy about it but... eek.
This place has quickly become a regular for us!! The spicy cucumber appetizer is refreshing and Delish! Everything on the menu is great...it's not oily like most honest places...the meat is always very fresh, and the service is very friendly and helpful.

The lo miens are scrumptious - not too overbearing with spices and oil. 

Carry out is very prompt as well.
This was so amazing I almost overdosed. Seriously,  I had a hard time walking or breathing when I left because I devoured so much of this deliciousness. 
*Dan dan noodles are my new favorite Chinese dish - they were unbelievably wonderful
*Hot pepper chicken was perfectly crispy and the heat level was right where I like it
*Garlic pork was a nice mild compliment to the hot pepper chicken and was also filled with yummy veggies and a delectable sauce
All of this plus great service and you can BYOB! I will be a regular.  LOVED IT!
The Crispy Rice Style was OK... it wasn't sizzling though even though the menu description said it would :(  that was the main reason we sat down!  Do not take this home as a left over... the crispy rice gets soggy and not so good... for some reason I did not think that through at the time.

The pea leave with garlic sauce is good!  generous chunks of garlic!  

The spicy cucumbers still doesn't fail to disappoint, but service this time did though (which hasn't happened before at Han).
I am grateful for Han Dynasty for being the only decent Chinese restaurant in Manayunk, but quality, taste, and even portion size are so inconsistent here. I have moved across Philly 5 times in the past 4 years, and thus have frequented their other locations...but this place is sub par for Han Dynasty standards across all categories. Unfortunately, this is still the only Chinese restaurant I'll choose when I get the craving and too lazy to drive outside of Manayunk, so 3 stars it is.
When this restaurant initially came to main street I was very skeptical.  I was wondering what could break the string of dud restaurants (i.e. Ben and Jerry's, Beijing Garden, Main Street Noodle House, Cavo Crepe Cafe) that inhabited this location.  

I read an article where Han, the owner, was quoted as saying his goal was to open 100 locations.  The article also stated that this location offered a 20 course tasting menu once a month.  I loved variety so I had to try it.  This tasting menu ending up being one of the most exciting, spicy and authentic dining experiences I've ever had.  Simply amazing!!!  We were able to sample just about everything on the menu, from fish to chicken, to pork, beef and even vegetarian dishes each loaded with their own number (from 1 to 10) indicating their spiciness.  This was not your typical General Tso and Lo mien, but a whole new authentic American Chinese where plenty of hot peppers and spice are welcomed on the dishes.  The only thing to make this a better a better experience is that it is a BYO.
This is my 3rd Han Dynasty experience, but first in Manayunk so I was very excited. It's BYOB! And they don't take reservations for parties less than 5, two changes I noticed from their Philadelphia location. 

No reservations wasn't a problem as our party of 4 was immediately seated around 615 on a Wednesday. I couldn't help but notice that the decor here compared to the Philadelphia location was.....dismal. Reminiscent of your local take out chinese place? Certainly caught me by surprise since I knew Han Dynasty is much more than that, and I have to say I was nervous, hoping it wouldn't impact the food!

Well it certainly didn't, the food was amazing  as usual! We got the Dan Dan noodles at a 3, the cold sesame noodles (I could eat these all day! Craving them again as we speak), and the dumplings in chili oil to start. For dinner we got 3 variations of the garlic sauce style: pork, chicken, and shrimp at varying heat levels, and also the kung pao chicken. All were delicious, though the Kung pao chicken was pretty fatty. We also shared the veggie fried rice which was good but I wouldn't order it again because there are so many other unique dishes here that the fried rice tastes pretty plain in comparison. 

Once again I stress to be cautious about the spice levels, 3-4 can get pretty hot and I'm a sriracha and hot wing lover so I'm pretty tough when it comes to spice. Just be careful because one dish that's too spicy can ruin the meal for you, I've experienced it! We got nothing over 4 and really enjoyed everything. 

Now if they could just renovate this place so it looked like the one I'm philly, wow. That would be glorious! Much more high end.
This restaurant was very delicious and had great service. The Kung pao chicken was phenomenal and very spicy. We got the dumplings in chili oil for an appetizer, which we were also extremely yummy. The spring rolls were only okay though. It's BYOB so we picked up some wine right down the street on Main. There's parking on Levering (which is very close) if you can't find a spot on main. Overall, it was a very good experience, and I will definitely be back.
Its with dismay that I write this review. I'm writing this in hopes that the owners read these reviews and make the necessary changes.

The food at Han Dynasty is amazing.  Its some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Every time I go there, I'm blown away by the food.

On the contrary, Han Dynasty has some of the worst service I've ever received.  Ever.  From seating to check, we literally had to ask for everything.  We had to flag someone down to get a table.  We had to flag our waiter down to order food.  We had to flag the bus boy down for drink refills because our waiter was nonexistent. The food arrived at sporadic intervals without regard to courses.  We had to flag the bus boy again to get our check.  

There were spans of 20~30 minutes in which our table was not visited by staff whatsoever.  A couple with a great window seat just got up and left because they were waiting so long before the staff greeted them.  My girlfriend and I were there for over 2 hours, despite ordering only a modest amount of food.

I've been to this restaurant over 5 times since they've opened.  Service has been getting worst every time.  Its something my friends all mention about Han Dynasty.  

Honestly, service has degraded to the point that I would consider Han Dynasty if I'm getting delivery or take out.  Or if I'm with a group large enough to order the tasting menu.  

You may win all sorts of awards and commendations. But that does NOT give you the leeway to rest on your laurels and ignore customers.  We gave you these awards, now keep working at it.
The food at Han Dynasty is authentic chinese food. You will not find americanized asian dishes here. The prices are reasonable and the ambiance perfect for a nice date night. About $50 dinner for two. The way the menu is set up as different than most chinese restaurants.  They have chicken, beef, pork or shrimp and can cook them about 12 different ways with different "heat" levels that can be lowered or highered on a scale of 1-10. We ordered our entree at a level 3 and it definitely had some kick to it! Also a MUST HAVE is the wonton soup. It's enough to share for 2 and is the best I have ever had. I order this every time I come. Love this place!!
In a world that constantly demands sacrifice in one way or another, i was delighted with the chance to treat MYSELF and a friend to some delicious Han Dynasty AND sate my constant craving for spicy food!

Oh man. It was all so good. We were lucky to order for pickup on a Friday night not too long before closing, and it was one of the better decisions i've made in a long time. i had already been to Han Dynasty here in Brooklyn, so i was on some, "Philly betta represent!!!" And they did.

The rundown: 
- The dry pepper fish: on point! Not as spicy as i would have liked (i like to feel the pepper in my ears - yeah i know i have problems), but it was perfectly seasoned, battered, and prepped. i truly love all the chopped up chiles around the fish cuz i actually eat them. Good times!

- The double-fried fish: This was my friend's request and i enjoyed some of it. Nicely seasoned, but a bit saucy for me. My homie enjoyed it too.

- The custom ordered fried rice with egg and onion: Perfect for pairing with our respective fish dishes.

- The STAR OF THE SHOW: The pea leaves with garlic! Why oh why did i hate veggies when i was little? Oh i know - cuz Han Dynasty's pea leaves with garlic were never on my plate! Real talk: if i could only order the pea leaves dish for the rest of my life, i'd consider it a life well-lived.

Overall: Be aware! You WILL pay quite a few coins for your order. i def paid $65 for all that i described above, BUT we had enough for dinner plus leftovers the next day for 2 chicks that LOVE to eat. Plus the entrees came with lots of white rice that we didn't eat. Next time i'll tell them to hold the extra rice. So...now you know - it's worth it!
We walked in on a Monday evening for dinner and stood in the doorway for ten minutes before we walked out! 3 employees walked back and forth without acknowledging my family. I will never return their service sucks!
Ok, I'm bumping it up a notch because even though my dish wasn't at all what I was expecting (based on the many times and many places I've had it) and it is waaayyy too oily, it does taste delicious.  And I could fish out what I wanted to heat up so it wasn't as greasy.  I don't know, I'll probably give this place another try but won't have it delivered.  So far definitely not worth the extra charges.
My experience at the Han Dynasty can be described as nothing more than a complete disaster right from the moment I made reservations. It was Saturday night and I called to see if there were any available reservations for two at 6:45. The woman who answered the phone informed me that 6:45 would be ok as long as we were out of the restaurant by 8:00. I thought it was a little odd that someone would tell us a time to be out by, but didn't really mind since that seemed like an adequate amount of time to eat. Little did I know that by 8:00 I wouldn't have even received my appetizer yet, but I digress. 

 We arrived right on time at 6:45 and were promptly seated at the smallest table known to man right against a drafty window on Main Street. The server started the night off just fine; even though they were fairly busy, right away we had out bottle of wine opened, were given water and by seven we had ordered a fairly simple order of an entrée, lo mein, and dumplings. From there things went downhill fast. It was about 7:45 when I started to get a little restless as we had yet to receive our appetizer. It wasn't until about 20 minutes later until our server finally made it over to our table to check on us and noticed we had yet to receive any food. This was the first time the server checked in on us since we ordered! 

Finally at about 8:30 we received the dumplings which were very bland and did not include the chili aoli that the menu had said it came with, but at that point we were very hungry and ate them anyways. At about 8:45 our entrée came out, but there was no lo mein. I thought maybe this would come separate as I noticed this is how other tables were being served, but unfortunately it never came. The entrée we did receive had little flavor and by 9:00 we were just ready to get out of there so instead of asking for our other order, I asked for the check.  

When the check came it had included the lo mein which never came so I had to stand up and track someone down to remove it. When the check came back there were now two orders of dumplings, but we had only ordered one so back the check went again. Normally, third time is a charm, but of course not in this case.  Finally after four attempts we were able to pay and leave hungry and extremely unsatisfied. 

If you are looking for service, good food or atmosphere I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Even if I could get past the poor service as there is no way a place could stay open with my experience being the norm, the food we actually received was nothing better than something you can find in the freezer at your local grocery store.
Honestly, I think the food here could be a bit spicier to be truly authentic. However, based on the majority of the customers here, who are not Chinese, the flavors are adjusted. 

We ordered the beef tendon in chili oil, which is a stable dish I order in Szechuan restaurants. We also ordered the spicy fish and string beans. I liked the beef tendon and thought it was quite flavorful. However, there were way too much chili oil. The fish dish was good, though it could be a bit spicier. Also, I didn't like the fact that the fish was battered. Lastly, the string bean dish was a good complementary dish to the other 2 dishes. It's cooked a bit too long, but it's not bad.

Overall, I think this place is decent, but if you want real authentic Szechuan food, I think R&Z Ping Pong is much much better.
The food is pretty good.  I will give them that, and that is why this review has 2 stars instead of 1.  I live on Main Street in Manayunk and frequent many of the restaurants.  I had been there two times before and the food was pretty good and the service was decent as well.  

However this time, I went in on a Monday evening an hour before they closed.  We were seated immediately by a man who seemed unhappy to see us and unhappy to seat us, and brought water.  Unfortunately that is where the service ended. With only two other tables being used in the restaurant and 3 service employees working in the front we were 100% ignored for 24 minutes.  We were never given a menu and no one ever came to our table.  The man who seated us went out of his way to ignore me many times.  I attempted to make eye contact with him several times to which he looked at me and went and did something completely unproductive, like quickly wipe a table that had not been used, or just walk around.  I attempted to use hand signals again to no avail.  Finally after 24 minutes I went to the front desk where a young woman was working and was greeted with a "whats up?"  I explained to her that I was trying to get everyone in the restaurants attention and we have been sitting there for 24 minutes completely ignored.  She acted somewhat surprised and tried to hand me a menu to which I some what laughed and told her we were leaving.  Which we did. 

It was glaringly obvious the man just did not want us to eat there and instead of tell us so he let us sit and blatantly ignored more for nearly a half hour.  I have never been so insulted in a restaurant in my entire life.  It is comforting that I read 2 other reviews that had similar experiences.  At least I know this place has the worst service of any midscale restaurant I've ever been to.  

Needless to say I will NEVER give this restaurant my business again.  I had been recommending this restaurant to my friends due to the food being pretty good, but I will make sure they all know never to eat here.  If you value service in anyway, you will be absolutely insulted to pay these prices to get treated like dirt.  Don't eat here!
Rubber band found in my food and staff didn't care. Didn't even replace dish. Definitely will never go back.
Best Chinese food I have ever had. Came here for lunch with my other half after an exhausting half day of moving into the neighborhood. Was greeted cheerfully and enthusiastically by our waiter who was so excited for us when he found out it was our first time at Han Dynasty that he started raving about the authenticity of the food here and the way in which it gets prepared. These days, it is so refreshing and rare to hear wait staff truly and really love the food they serve. What a fantastic guy. He definitely made our experience even better. We took his advice and ordered the Dan Dan noodles to start. Holy crap, these were SO Good. Words could never do them justice- just get them! 

For lunch, we ended up ordering the hot sauce style chicken (stir fried with cabbage, garlic, and celery in an authentic Sichuan chili oil hot sauce; spice factor 7/10) and the garlic sauce style chicken  (Sweet, sour, and spicy-stir fried with ginger, garlic, bamboo, 
wood ear mushrooms, and bell peppers; we asked for the spice factor to be raised to a 5/10). The hot sauce style entree was good but I found the sauce consistency to be much too thin for my liking and the sauce to sort of hit one flat note-SPICY- likely because of its Sichuan chili oil base. Nonetheless, still great flavor and true to its name/description. The garlic sauce stir fry really stole the show. Extremely well-balanced in flavors. We loved how the sauce adhered to the chicken and veggies. SO GOOD. 

Side note: The dishes are served family style so share so you get a varied and eclectic host of flavors! 

Truly unlike any other Chinese food experience I have ever had. I cannot wait to bring my friends from out of town here. Plus, they are byob! Come here!
We came in with a stroller and were made to feel very unwelcome. First the employee/waiter asked if the stroller folded up. We said yes. We asked if they had a high chair and he said yes, so we thought great problem solved. Then he showed us to a table that had plenty of room to slide a stroller next to it without impacting traffic patterns in the restaurant, and he said he could not give us a high chair despite the fact that he had just said he had one. We asked to park the stroller in the empty space instead, and he said we couldn't do that because he expected the restaurant to get busy. It was only about 20% full at 6:30 pm on a weeknight. Even if the restaurant were busy, the stroller would not be a problem, I thought. His general demeanor and unkind face made it clear he wanted us to leave and was going to continue to come up with excuses to kick us out. We left and took our business down the street to Winnie's where we felt incredibly welcome. We won't return to Han Dynasty.
Yuck, yuck yuck. We had heard good things about Han, so we decided to check out the Manayunk restaurant. We made an 8pm reservation, to which we arrived a little early. Told we had to wait, which was fine. Then, the hostess showed me which table she was cleaning for us, but then a minute later, told us we needed to sit at another table closer to the kitchen and right next to the bathrooms, b/c they needed our original table for a 4 -top b/c it was more comfortable. They looked to be the same size tables to me!

We finally were sat, and no one came to our table for a good 10 minutes. Finally, someone noticed us, and just said - "Oh, do you need something?" Instead of a "Hi, welcome, etc here are our specials etc etc". We ordered the spicy cucumbers, which were slapped down on the opposite end of the table. Totally swimming in chili oil, my husband could barely stomach them. 

He ordered chicken lo mein - only teeny tiny pieces of chicken came with it. Again, it was delivered by slapping it down on the opposite end of the table, not even really right in front of him. His dish was good enough tasting. I ordered pork and crispy rice. Well, I'm not even sure the pork was pork. We finally finished...and in the meantime, no one came to check on us, no one asked us how the meal was. 

Finally we had to flag someone down to get our check. This place has horrible service. HORRIBLE! Do not go here. I'm not even sure why people love the food so much...SO overrated.
I'm giving Han Dynasty 3 stars- 4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service.

As to the food, the highlights of our meal were the dan dan noodle appetizer, the cucumber appetizer, the salt and pepper style shrimp, the eggplant in garlic sauce (the garlic sauce is sweet and tangy), the dry fry style beef and the cumin style chicken. Some items that we ordered were not as well liked: wontons in chile oil, taiwanese sausage (thin sliced smoked sausage served on a plate with no sauce), and the tea smoked duck (not everyone at our table enjoyed the heavy smoked flavor).  The food is on the spicy side, so be mindful of the "hotness" rating from 1 to 10 on the menu!  They can alter the spice to your liking.

As to the service, the restaurant seems very disorganized - we were slow to be seated, standing in the doorway for a long time waiting for our table to be set even though we had called ahead for a reservation for our party of 6.  The couple ahead of us also seemed to have been waiting along time for their table for 2.  The attitude of the staff is somewhat disinterested.  Once we ordered, the food came quickly, although the entrees came out at different times.

Overall, we really enjoyed this restaurant and will come back.  Han Dynasty is BYOB and I recommend a light alcohol beer because you need a lot of liquid to wash down the spicy food!  I recommend coming here with a large group so you can try lots of things. They have two large round tables with lazy susan in the center if you can get one of these it is ideal.
I cant believe with all my check-ins on fb I've never reviewed this place! I've been to every Han Dynasty in Philly including 3 separate tasting menus. Needless to say I am a huge fan of this food. Real szechuan style. I love my food spicy ("10"!) & this place serves it up in spades. Han is also a laugh riot and fun loving guy. My favorites are dry pot style, usually the lamb. Also Mapo: its spicy tofu with minced pork. The wonton soup is also very good. Orange Chicken is awesome but only served in the Montgomery county restaurant.  And of course everybody loves the Dan dan noodles about a "6" on the spicy scale so pretty much everyone can handle the heat. Chinese are not known for their pastries so skip desert.  Byob at this reastaunt but west philly and old city have their liquor license. I deserve a free t-shirt for this review!
Food was wikid good!! Reasonable prices. Have the pepper scallops on a 10!! Wow like it spicy 
They are more than happy to dial it down on the heat index if you can't stand the heat. Food was bey tasty. Will try the cherry hill one next.
This is a tough review to write, but it's necessary. 

I LOVE the food at Han Dynasty, and I'm usually dining at the Old City location, so when we were wandering through Manayunk looking for a lunch spot and saw Han Dynasty it was a no brainer.

We knew that we wanted dan dan noodles, and some Taiwanese sausage. My fiance and I wanted to split the order of dan dan  as an appetizer and my friend wanted her own as her entree. 

Since we were splitting the dan dan we finished our bowl and my friend didn't finish hers (it is a huge portion for one person). The waitress comes over and comments how I finished the entire bowl by saying, "oh wow. you finished all of that?" and I explained that we split it, but followed up with, "But it would be okay if I did finish the entire bowl" - because, it's not her business how much I eat, and you'd think that a business would be thrilled that a patron loved the meal that much. Anyway- it took me aback a bit.

My fiance and I get our entrees and we realized that we ordered WAY too much. The waitress comes over and says, "Oh wow. You finished?" So if we eat all of it, she says something...we don't eat enough (according to her) she says something. So we get the massive plate of food wrapped up to go along with a few other things and they arrive at the table in a tied plastic bag. We don't think anything of it and head back to center city. The next day we go to dig into our leftovers and the restaurant only gave us 1/4 pint of food- when we literally had a HUGE plate of lo mein that we took 2 bites of. So they must have been upset with us for not finishing it, or thought we didn't need all of our leftovers- whatever the reason- we were sent home with a VERY small amount of food compared to what we wanted wrapped up. Essentially they stole from us. We paid for the full amount and only received a small fraction of it to take home. 

Luckily we don't frequent Manayunk, so we won't be back to this location to deal with the judgmental service and spotty doggie bags.
No exaggeration, Han Dynasty is as good as it gets!

I honestly wasn't expecting much since the only Chinese food I'm really accustomed to are the greasy corner shops behind 3 inches of bullet proof glass... but we're not comparing apples to apples with Han.  We literally left about an hour ago and I felt it necessary to write a review right away while the szechuan and hot sauce flavors are still on the tip of my tongue.

When you go to Han, go for the Dan Dan noodle appetizer (which is the size of an entree) and the crunch cucumber appetizer.  I asked them to surprise me with an entree and they brought out the peppered shrimp - amazing!  My wife went for the Hot Pot that was loaded with szechuan; if you're new to szechuan, be prepared!  It's not spicy, it actually has a tingling effect that enhances every flavor in the dish.  It even makes water have an interesting taste!

I could go on and on about the food but what made everything even better was the service.  The owner spent time explaining the different flavors and dishes and made excellent recommendations.  Go with an open mind and you won't be disappointed!
Han is spicy and being Indian, well, I love that! The one thing I don't love is how everything we ordered was drenched in a moat of chilli oil. It started out good but eventually, in a gradual descent, the meal became nauseating. 

The Dan Dan noodles were awesome, and the spice level was perfect for us, but again, after a couple bites we just couldn't get the coating of oil out of our mouths.

Would we be back? Perhaps, but way down the line when we feel our stomachs and psyche can handle it.

Finally, the service was SLOW to say the least. Everyone that works there is extremely nice but we seemed to wait forever on everything- even our check.
The good up front.
Very clean nice place, although midway through a busy Saturday dinner shift the bathroom was kind of messy but not gross.  BTW, there is just 1 bathroom.

Service was quick and attentive, food was good in terms of generous portions, fresh, tasty well made food.

Now the bad:

I came expecting an E Mai SPICE level place - we went because we expected spicy food.  We ordered Dan Dan noodles, boiled dumplings in hot oil and Garlic Sauce style chicken.

The Dan Dan were very mild and loads of oil, the dumplings were about the same.  The chicken was delicious and right where I would call a level 3 spice.

I just have to write off the mild (like a number 1.5) Dan Dan and dumplings to a bad day in the kitchen or suburban style spice - the chicken was about perfect.

If you want spicy however I will be at Old City Han Dynasty or E Mai.  I report, you decide.
Good food...but overpriced. (Main Street location)

I ordered spicy tofu with vegetables and extra bok choy wuth brown rice, my usual order that I previously paid ~$13 for just a week or two earlier. I was told over the phone that it would be $13.99, which is fine. It was listed as $12.95 on their website. When I arrived to pick it up I was told that my order did not include brown rice and was now $16 :-/ That's not a lot of money but it's literally rice with vegetables and tofu. There's a place in Lansdale that makes the same thing, but better, and it's like $9. 

 When I told the guy that I was told a different amount he just gave me a blank stare. I paid because it was late and I just needed food but I won't be ordering from there again. The customer service sucks, in general and the food isn't anything amazing.
The missus and I stopped in her to kill some time while we were in Manyunk. This is one of my favorite spots. I ordered the Hot Sauce Chicken w/brown rice and my wife had the Garlic Sauce Shrimp. The hot sauce is pretty spicy but very good. The Garlic Sauce is definitely the way to go. There are so many options on their menu it's hard to decide. 

I do not live anywhere near this restaurant but I make the trip to Philly for some of their excellent cuisine.
I love Han Dynasty, however, the Manuyunk location food is definitely different than the Han Dynasty in Old City and University City. The dishes were a bit more bland with more of an Americanized taste/flavor. The menu options were also a little different, where there was a "traditional dishes" and "American dishes". 

Some locations cater to the demographics of the locations and I definitely think the Manuyunk location caters to a more "American" taste than the authentic flavors. 

If you're looking for a good spicy Sichuan food, I'd recommend trying to the Han Dynasty in University city. That is by far my favorite!
The best Han Dynasty in the Philadelphia area in my opinion. This is a spice lovers dream and real Chinese food not take out garbage. I have been to this location multiple times and it never disappoints. The one night that stood out to me was when I came here with about 12 others and we had a large circular table perfect for sharing all the family style food. The spice levels are indicated by number so ask your server before you order if you are confused by anything. Also, this location is BYOB so head to Pitchers down the block or any of the local bars, fill up a growler and bring it to dinner. The best dishes I had were the Dan Dan noodles, a must for everyone and personally loved the rabbit.
I've enjoyed eating here, but now I'm a bit wary as I see they were shut down due to 4 violations by the health inspectors.
This is my favorite Han Dynasty Location. It's BYO and the staff is always super friendly. I think the food is more consistent (and delicious) than the other locations I've been too. Garlic Sauce Style Chicken is my favorite.
This was my first time at a any of the Han Dynasty restaurants,  this one happen to be BYOB.. I looked at the website prior to going, I don't recall that being noted. Luckily my friend called ahead and found out it was BYOB so she picked up some wine.  
The food was very good and I liked that you could give them a heat/spice range, unfortunately they didn't follow it. My delicious had a 1 heat range and it was spice, my friend, who loves spicy food asked for her dish to be 5 instead of the noted in the menu 8. Her fish was sooo good but way to spicy for me and even gave her some challenges.  
Also they didn't bring a wine chiller. 
I look forward visiting another Han Dynasty.
My overall impression: a very solid Sichuan Chinese restaurant that also does takeout (!). Han Dynasty has a medium-sized interior that gets crowded on popular nights, so plan ahead and don't forgot to BYOB. All of the food can be served family-style as well, so you should all try to coordinate your spice preferences as much as possible. 

Must-have: the spicy crispy cucumber appetizer. About four large cucumbers come sliced up and served in a spicy sauce. It's rated a seven, but the cucumbers have enough of a cooling effect that you really don't notice the bite. I regret eating them all last night, but they were too good to save. I also ate a lot of my friend's braised beef soup, which was full of tender beef and cilantro--in a word, amazing.

I also got the dan dan noodles (very mild, although rated a 6 in spiciness), which were very well-balanced and not overpowering (peanuts can be really hard-hitting) and the garlic sauce style (beef). The dan dan noodles were great, but I wasn't blown away and the garlic sauce was delightfully strong (very gingery) and definitely heavier on the spicy than on the sweet or sour. I tried ONE bite of my friend's dry pepper style chicken and practically died. Great flavor and well-fried (I would hope, as they fry it three times), but dear Lord the spice!

Finally, the waiter told us that he sends the tickets for each course as soon as the previous course hits the table, so be prepared for VERY quick service and succession of dishes. Since it was a slow night, he was really accommodating and sent the orders in more slowly so that my friend and I weren't overwhelmed by the enormous amount of food we ordered.
One of the few Chinese places that I would recommend to a friend visiting Philly. For some reason I haven't fallen in love with Philly Chinese food, but Han Dynasty makes the cut!

Lovee the dry pepper chicken!! The garlic lamb was also really good. Pork belly double cooked style was a little disappointing but we fixed the soggy texture on our pan at home. Veggie selections have been just ok as I've tried both the bok choy and the string beans which I prefer slightly over the boring bok choy. The Dan Dan noodles are pretty good too as the other reviews rave :) but I still prefer simple steamed rice a lot of the times to complement the super tastey entrees they have here.

Service is always very friendly! The food is prepared fast and tastes amazingly fresh all three times I've ordered takeout from here. Prices and portions aren't great as I'm used to the quaint authentic hole in the wall gems back home in California.
It always pulls at my little foodie heartstrings to go to a place with exceptional expectations and have those expectations absolutely not met especially when I was super duper hungry and spoiling myself with my love of Chinese cuisine. Why you do Han Dynasty, why you do? Def was not happy about usuing my bonus weight watcher points at this place!

First, the service here could have been faster if performed by Galapagos tortoises. I wish that were not the case but it was and there were quite a few times where I needed something such as a refill of water, that did not get done. Honestly, if it is that much trouble at that point please just leave a pitcher at the table becaue the food is super spicy and my mouth was not happy (I mean...I love spicy food I just don't like waiting for water through the searing saucy pain)! Hello. 

I have to say despite this little or BIG fudge-up in service the food IS super delicious. We started our dining experience off with the steamed dumplings in the chili oil. Those little suckers were an addictingly delicious appetizer...and I mean, can't stop at one and have to fight off the other people ninja style for that last dumpling smothered in every last drop of chili oil good. We also got a round of some Dan Dan Noodles which again... I will fork my own husband dare he try and sneak one more noodle then equally portioned out. 

We decided to have our main entrees spread out for everyone to try and all of the dishes were bursting with spicy, rich, and savory flavors. My favorite was the lamb swimming in perfectly steamed vegetables with a nice medium hot sauce over their sticky rice. I kind of hated that I had to fight against some bones to get all of that marvelous lamb meat but it certainly was worth the minimal amount of effort. 

Han Dynasty, I am willing to forgive and forget if you step up your game in service. For now I may partake in your take out so I don't have to be disappointed by your staff but if I should ever sit and eat again, make me feel special.
A must try.  Great for people who like spicy food.  I have a low tolerance but you can still find good eats.  Dan Dan noodles, kung pao chicken, string beans w/minced pork - all amazing. BYOB too.
Yes, the food is delicious. 
The Dan Dan noodles do not disappoint. 
The cold sesame noodles are always satisfying. 
But what left a sour taste in our mouths tonight was the disgustingly RUDE service. 

We have been coming to Han Dynasty in Manayunk for many years. They have always chilled the wine we've brought, cleared our plates promptly and packed up our leftover food. But tonight they did none of these things. Is there new management??
I went here back in December for a late lunch.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food, but I can't give 4 stars due to the lack of customer service.  The place was practically empty but the service was soooooooo damned slow.  Also, the waiters weren't very pleasant in that when I asked for something, it was made to feel like I was bothering them.  So, I would maybe get take out, but I wouldn't rush back to eat here unless they went out of their way to impress me.  

Scallion pancakes were light, flaky and delicious.  The wonton soup was flavorful and soothing.
My wife and I have traveled to (and dined well in) China and Taiwan, but the food we enjoyed tonight at Han Dynasty in Manyunk surpassed all!  We had a table for ten, so we were able to sample many dishes, including Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy  Crispy Cucumber, Scallion Pancake, Crispy Rice Style Fish, Black Bean Style Beef, Garlic Sauce Style Chicken, Pea Leaves Garlic and a few others.  We cleaned all plates.  I cannot give an order of preference because all were 5 star (or 5 bells if you're from the Delaware Valley).  The servers were informative, prompt, and could not do enough to please you.  And, it's a BYO.  Don't miss this restaurant.
Oh how I love their dumplings. This place is awesome, food, quick service, and outstanding quality if you're searching for "not your Mama's Chinese food". The lunch specials are pretty nice as well.
This review is concerning only to the Main Street Han Dynasty. We are a huge fan of Han Dynasty and make a point to eat here whenever we visit Philly. They have a decent menu with multiple meat options, the food was definitely good as always but I am more pissed off at the service.

The waiter is not at all friendly and never acknowledges our requests not even with a nod. The only response he gives is a yes or no. When requested for straws for our water he responded by saying "All requests at once". After enduring the process of ordering food the food came out. The portions were so small and we had to order 2 entrees each to fill our stomachs.For the price they are charging the portions are unacceptable and well funny(we tried different Han dynasties and they serve way bigger portions.

I would definitely eat at Han when I visit Phlilly but not at the same location.
I've been to this place a couple of time and the service had always been great.  The food is even better.  DAN DAN noodles are the MAN MAN!!! Only complaint is one time i got a tea cup with lipstick on it -gross...  Oh and don't forget it's BYOB and for so damn reason there isn't alcohol other than beer at bars for purchase near by.
I really, really wanted to like this Han Dynasty location. With its proximity both to home and to a nearby delicious cookie bar, it's the perfect combination for the ultimate cheat day! I tried just the Dan Dan noodles here, and also ordered the garlic style chicken for my husband.

Anyone who absolutely loves Dan Dan noodles, and is familiar with the merging of flavors from the chili oil, to the sesame paste, to the soy sauce, to the garlic and ground pork bits (I could go on, but I'm making myself hungry) knows that the heat level can get pretty intense! But the noodles I had, even after feverishly mixing them together to fully coat them in the sauce, were a dud. I could've fed them to a toddler with no worries. 

When I'm looking for my dish to make me sweat it out like I'm in a sauna, I'll probably have to head over to U City.
This meal was two thumbs up  with a snap! I totally enjoyed every dish I ordered! Braised beef soup was the first dish to come out and it was fabulous! Tough act to follow but Matt you guys pulled it off! Very nice service and friendly! Smiles all around & we will be back very soon with more! Oh and not to mention this place is BYOB!
So I have to of the best tour guides you could ask for whenever I'm in Philly! One is a seasoned Yelper (Marissa C) who always is in the know! Well we were looking for a place to kick off my birthday night this year and my friends recommended this place. We went and had a great time. 

All the portions are huge and meant for sharing! The best it's B.Y.O. This was my first experience at a B.Y.O. establishment but I will definitely try this more often. We rolled in with a 24 pack or so of various beers to wash down the spicy goodness that would be coming our way. 

The staff was great, service was prompt and attentive. They deal with a lot of groups and larger parties here, so it's going to be loud. The environment is actually pretty cool. The food was great, the dan dan noodles were awesome! Do yourself a favor and stop getting them from your nearest PF Changs.  The dry pot style shrimp also required a 2nd serving! 

Now to the personal touch that makes me really love this place. The night we were here was also the night Whitney Houston died and the news broke via Twitter while we were dining. You could kind of see how different groups were finding out and the mood and the restaurant became more and more somber with each table receiving the news. Well a guy at the table next to us just happened to have Whitney's collection on his Iphone and the staff was more than happy to plug it up when we asked! Needless to say with hit like Dance with somebody and some other Whitney dance tracks, people spirits were restored and the place was jamming.

It kicked off to a great night and made for a memorable birthday!
Ate here twice in the past month even though I live in Ocean County, NJ. Why? This is the best Chinese restaurant outside of NYC's Chinatown. They specialize in the spicier dishes but they can be customized to your comfort level. Dan dan noodles, the pork belly dishes, ma po tofu, sauteed pea leaves, bok choy... all hits, no misses. The only thing I hate is that I live so far away. Highly recommended.

Check out their website.
Han dynasty does not care about their customers. I used to eat there at least once/week and I never got a friendly smile or recognition from any of the servers. They always seem pissed off about something. The food is good, so I kept going back. 
This last week, I went there with friends who had a 5 month old baby. We took the stroller in and were seated next to the bathroom. The restaurant was almost empty, so we asked politely to be seated elsewhere. The server flatly refused! Then proceeded to say they do not allow strollers inside the restaurant (but there were no signs and he didn't ask us to close the stroller when we first entered). When we started protesting, he threw us out!! HE THREW US OUT! I will take my money and go somewhere else.
Really don't know what has happened to this place. Used to go all the time but the last couple of times I've went have been serioisly underwhelmed.

Spicy cucumbers are always a safe pic and they're delicious. Most of the other dishes are supppperrr greasy. The eggplant was horrible- it was so soggy. The meat dishes are generally okay but nothing spectacular.

Now let's get to customer service, TERRIBLE! And not just once or twice or on a crowded night it's consistently horrible. Good luck getting anything after your order is taken. More water? You'll have to flag someone down for that as well as anything else you may need. No one comes around to check on you and see how the dishes are. Last time I went our food was taking a long time and I noticed everyone else around us (even those that got seated after us) had gotten their dishes. The servers kept coming over to look at the table, we'd make eye contact and they'd walk away. It was like they were avoiding having to tell us what the hold up was. Finally got someone's attention and all they said was "it's coming". No apologies - no one even came around to check on us. One of our  dishes was so bad it went untouched. Finally flagged down the server for the bill, he asked how everything was when I mentioned the dish we didn't care for and he said nothing just took our plates away. You think they'd bring the bill after that? Nope- had to flag someone down for that too. 

Overall the customer service is a joke. They really need to train their employees. Food is just okay.
Awesome service and location. Dan dan noodles are the best I ever had and the spicy chicken is really good. The wanton soup is legit. Good portions and price is reasonable. Five stars to me.
Maybe I'm a health freak. Maybe I'm overly sensitive to sodium. Maybe I just read too many awesome reviews before going. Maybe Han was on vacation. Whatever the reason, I was not as impressed with Han Dynasty as others on Yelp. 

The service was slow ordering, which looking back I'm glad because it gave me time to drink some wine and relax given that the food came out so quickly. Which also makes me nervous. 

So what did I get? Well I was excited to try the Dan Dan Noodles since they were highly recommended. I got them with out meat so I'm wondering if that was the reason they weren't as good as people said. All I tasted was salt. So I moved on to the Bok Choy with Blackened Mushrooms. Again, salt. Just as I was about to mention the overpowering presence of salt, my friend's dish came out.

He had the duck with ginger and on his first bite, he commented on the salt. Ah, so it wasn't just me. I didn't try the duck since I don't eat meat but I'm going to take his word for it. Someone commented that they keep your water glasses full and my guess is because you are going to be thirsty after consuming this much sodium. I went home and consumed 3 glasses of water on top of the water I consumed at the restaurant. 

I really hope I'm wrong about this place since it seems like it's popular. Hopefully it was just an off night.
Han Dynasty is becoming a legend around these parts. It's easy to understand why once you try the food. If you are expecting oranage chicken or sweet and sour pork, this is not the place for you. 

I've been to Han Dynasty several times and I've tried a lot of things on the menu. My favorites are listed below:

Dan Dan Noodles - In my opinion, this is what the restaurant is known for. The flavor and texture of the dish is tremendous.

Cumin Style meat - I've had cumin style with pork and lamb. The flavor is heavy on cumin but not over powering. The dish is about medium heat level and very flavorful.

Garlic Eggplant - Without a doubt the best vegetable dish I have eaten...anywhere. I don't know what they do to this dish, but the flavor is insanely delicious. The texture of the eggplant is very soft and almost melts in your mouth. This is my favorite dish at Han Dynasty.

I love this place because it is so unique. When I come to Han Dynasty I feel like I've been trasported to the Szechuan region of China. The entire experience is spectacular.
This is a great spot if you are looking for authentic chinese and lots of options! 

This was actually the first chinese restaurant we've been to were they serve complimentary green tea (when we ate in person,) which we thought was a nice touch. 

Anything on the menu is worth trying, but in particular I would suggest dumplings or any spicy entree.
We have dined here twice, once for dinner (it was crowded and the tables are close together, so if you're not into that, skip the Friday/Saturday night experience). Lunch was a much quieter meal with only one other table occupied. 

The food is delicious. The prices are reasonable, the tea is weak but the spices are abundant and flavorful. The rice dishes are wonderful and I had the ribs at lunch, which had a great dry rub on them. Try the spring rolls. Small, but tasty.
I am still working thru the top 50 restaurants of Philly and a cold winter day brought me here.  The restaurant was freezing cold but the food warmed you up.  The service was excellent and our glasses were kept full and the waiter  regularly checked on us.  The dan dan noodles were fantastic and not as spicy as I feared.The bowl of wonton soup was humongous.  My friend has a pork dish that was the special of the day and was very good.  I hope to return in the near future.
This is one of our go-to weekday dinner spots in Manayunk because it's BYOB, the portions are big enough to share, and the service is consistent. Everything is ranked by spice level on a scale of 1 (not spicy) to 10 (spiciest). I wouldn't recommend Han if you are sensitive to spice because there are a few dishes that are ranked lower but still pack a punch. However, you do get a bowl of white rice with your meal to suppress any spiciness you are experiencing! A few of our favorites are the wontons in chili oil, Dan Dan noodles, and the cumin style chicken. The Dan dan noodles are sooo good and I highly recommend getting them. The cumin chicken (7) is flavorful but it is HOT...still doesn't stop us from ordering it though! Can't wait for our next date night to Han :)
Not as good as the U City location. They screwed up our order big time. The spicy consistency is way off. The Dan Dan noodles are supposed to be a 6, they were barely a 3. The pork with garlic and ginger we ordered mild and came out super spicy. The wonton with chili sauce was excellent. 
Our waiters kept changing throughout the night, perhaps that was where the mixup came from.
You know, I was debating writing a review considering that I had already done one of University City, right where I work. But this is by where I live, and I like having both.

I primarily use Han as takeout, and they are lightning fast. I don't think I've waited more than 10 minutes for an order. I think they're faster than the University location, and also spicier.

I'm a big fan of the Dan Dan Noodles, the Spicy Cucumber and especially the Kung Pao (with the spiciness jacked)
I finally got a chance to try this place as people tell me the food here is awesome. The service is definitely great. HOWEVER, there are some dishes here that I don't recommend anyone eating.  The fried rice and Dan Dan noodles were definitely fantastic. Now for the not so great dishes: hot sauce style chicken dish was filled with nothing but hot oil, the whole dish was covered in oil. I'm not trying to stress health but it just didn't look appetizing and it wasn't even spicy.  The sesame oil dumpling was also covered with mostly oil. I know it's in the name of the dish but c'mon, ease up on the oil. 
I would come back to this place for the non-oily dishes, this place does have some good food.
I wanted to LOVE this place...and let me say, taking into account JUST the food.....I DO!  However, the service is ATROCIOUS!   I went there for a business lunch, and it was 90 minutes, start to finish.  Completely unacceptable!  We were a party of 6- and our meal was so absurdly timed, I thought we were on Candid Camera.  2 of us got served 1st.  20 minutes later another 2 received their meals...and finally, another 20 minutes later,  the final 2 got served.  The waiter was nasty....and made US feel as if WE were inconveniencing him, when we asked about the status of our order.  This place could prepare the finest food in the land....but it is overshadowed by such incompetence and disregard- that not one person from my group will return to this location!!  The food was extraordinary though, and I will try their other spots- hoping that Manayunk is the only location with an attitude.

**update.  Just ate at the Cherry Hill location for dinner....and had the opposite experience.  5 stars- food and service!!
I have only been here one time, but it was by far the best Chinese food I have ever had in my life. The portions are family style sized so it's great to go with a group. It's also a BYOB which made it perfect for our girls night out. The dan dan noodles definitely rank in my top 20 favorite foods of all time. We also tried the pork belly which was delicious and a chicken dish that was also very good. I can't wait to go back and try some more items from their menu!
It kills me to write this review, especially because I've had some many good experiences at Han Dynasty on Penn's campus, but my last visit here was really underwhelming. 

We arrived at about 8pm on a Wednesday night, and there were several open tables when we got there. We stood around waiting for a little bit until someone came out at the back and gestured over a handful of tables, signifying "sit wherever you want." 

We picked a table and the waiter came over to open our beer--this location is BYOB, which is nice. We looked over the menu for awhile, and I asked how the tea-smoked duck was. He shook his head and said "I don't like it." Uh, well if this guy is supposed to be selling dishes and he says it's no good, I will trust him, I guess. So we ordered the pork belly in garlic sauce to start, followed by the spicy beef soup, and then the waiter's recommendation, the dry fried chicken. 

The best part of the meal was the pork belly. It was really delicious. I liked the beef noodle soup, too. It was a huge bowl full of dan dan noodles in a spicy broth with chunks of tender braised beef. You could really taste the cilantro too. My only critique is that it's a little oily. The dry fried chicken was not great. It was super salty and the majority of the dish is comprised of inedible, ornamental hot peppers. At something like $12, it's not a great value and wasn't that tasty. I mostly filled up on the pork belly. 

The main problem was that I spent nearly the entirety of a spicy meal attempting to get my water glass filled. If you're going to serve spicy food, you had better be filling people's glasses. I managed to get it filled once toward the end of the meal and another time by waving my hands in the air before we left. Our waiter seemed to disappear for long periods of time.

As we were paying, I told the waiter that I loved the pork belly. He said, "I don't like that either." I told him, "I should have gotten the duck. Next time I'm saying to bring me whatever you don't like!" We all laughed about it. 

The thing that I think drove down this review from 3 to 2* is that they were literally dragging sacks of trash through the dining room while people were eating to put them out on the curb. At point point they also started turning off the lights in the dining room, around 8:50 or so. I know you close at 9 and want to go home, but poor form is poor form. 

Would I go back here? Probably. I think they hired a very young, inexperienced waiter. Would I think twice about prioritizing this place above the array of other great places on Main St? Definitely.
With all the business lunches I go to Manayunk, I was a little surprised Han Dynasty never came up, especially with its stellar reputation. I think I figured out why on my first biz lunch trip there today.

1) The dishes are served family style. I'd hardly consider a business associate that I'm meeting for the first time to be family, and it makes dish selection challenging. I'd even have trouble selecting dishes with my own family and close friends. 

2) Spice levels are another consideration in a group dining setting. My spice level would make some run for a glass of milk to cool their tongue. As I'm more of the rarity then the norm, the less spicy options won out.

3) There's also the mess factor. Twirling away with the chopsticks isn't exactly my first nature, and trying to be overly polite and proper without getting (too much) sauce in my lap wasn't something I had prepared to do gracefully.

With all three members of my party being Han Dynasty first timers, we relied on our server for portion and dish recommendations; with the exception of the Dan Dan noodles, which I was not leaving until I tried. Our server steered us towards the appropriate number of dishes and a good selection of customer favorites.

With all that being said, I still enjoyed our dishes which included the Dan Dan noodles and lunch portions of the garlic chicken, black bean style fish and pork belly. The lunch menu is not listed online but I believe the pork belly was prepared double cooked style with leeks, hot peppers and fermented black beans, and chili oil. Everything was delicious and flavored in its own unique way. I just wish I was really able to dive into the experience.

I would have preferred to customize my spice level and indulge in a non business setting, but I learned my lesson the hardway. I'll be back to Han Dynasty to dine at my own leisure.
Last night, I checked out a highly rated place by Yelpers only to find I did not agree with them.  Today, I am happy to agee with the majority of Yelpers as I came here for lunch today.

Han Dynasty occupies a place that has gone through several Chinese tenants (I reviewed the previous tenant, Beijing Homestyle) and so, the place carries a curse of doomed Chinese restaurants to even this fellow spiritual skeptic. So, the Yelp reviews were not enough to persuade me.

Once I ordered and ate, I am happy to say I agree with them.  This is not the place to go if you want your typical take-out Chinese stuff. (Although, there is an section in the menu called Baby Adults for more typical stuff as fried rice).   So, go to your local take out in you want traditional Chinese.  But for those who are adventurous, the cuisines are unorthodox but made with a lot of detail to ingredients and spices.  In other words, this is not food just thrown in the stir-fry, they take their time to make an authentic but mouth-watering experience. Stuff can be very spicy, but they do warn you about spices as they have a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 least spiciest and 10 most spiciest. The scale is very accurate. I had a dumplings appetizer which rated a 4 and did require an extra class of water to wash down.

Given the good reviews and the many people that are coming here, this may be the place that finally breaks the curse of failed Chinese restaurants.
Let's talk about this experience this evening. Not only was it a great place to eat but a great atmosphere of happy people. 
    Service was stellar and probably because of the managements commitment to the product they produce. Everything that we had recommended to us was fantastic with a flavor profile out of this continent. Something you will not typically find a chinese food restaurant and I am glad I found it at this one. Hats off for a great meal. 
     Food came out fast and was always hot with the perfect spice profile for our needs. Yet again I can not stress the don don noodles and dumplings in chili oil. What a flavor profile and a excellent bit. 

Cheers to who ever is whipping up the food. Great pair with the black ipa from sierra nevada or for wine drinkers a great compliment to a italian tuscan blend.
Update: the more we (hubs or friends or hubs and friends and I) go, the less we like. I don't know if it's just us, but.....are the sauces of every dish starting to taste the exact same?? And, is it just us or do you too walk out a puffy fish from the massive overload of salt consumption?? It's NOT just from overeating, I swear!  

And, If they're getting so much love and hooplah, they've REALLY got to work on getting some servers who understand English and even better...your order, AND,  and...a touch of  some atmosphere would be nice.
We went there at dinner time on a Friday night so we weren't surprised it was busy. The food was AMAZING and the service was very nice and reasonable. My only complaint is that everyone working seemed so stressed out I felt tense watching them. Maybe I was just paranoid but it was hard to ignore. Anyway, I would try it again for sure. Food 10/10, service 9/10, atmosphere 7/10
First, to get it out of the way, everyone in Manayunk calls it "Handy Nasty."

Fancier Chinese food, for sure. The proprietor of this branch is super friendly, and walks around to say hi to people on busy nights. The wait can get a little intense depending on what time you go, especially in the summer. But the building itself is a converted old tin ceiling store front, and they cram a decent amount of tables into such a small space. 
All of the Han Dynasties can do most of the dishes gluten free if you ask! I get the kung pao chicken, which they do in corn starch, with Tamari. Never gotten sick from it, and it's tasty.
My one caution is the spice level. People tell you to order a level down, because of the reputation for it being so spicy, but then you're just left with this sickeningly sweet sauce that usually balances out the spicy. Order suggested level. Your taste buds will thank you.
When I die, please scatter my ashes in a bowl of Dan Dan noodles from Han Dynasty.

Jokes aside, this is far and away my favorite restaurant in Manayunk, and I've only ever ordered takeout. The restaurant itself if BYO, so one of these days when I remember to grab a bottle of wine I'll sit down to eat, but until then I'll be slurping up the spicy rich noodles from Han from the comfort of my couch.

Dan Dan is obviously my fave, but the chili dumplings and spicy beef soup are also favorites. Wasn't blown away by the kung pao, but need to try more of the menu when I'm not dying for heart-attack inducing food.
Still no better then before. Since I found Cheng Du in West Philly all the Hans are off my list.
My go to place for Szechuan in the Yunk and personally my favorite out of the 3 Han Dynasty's in Philly ( the one in Old City is consistently way too spicy, and the one in University City just feels and looks like a grade school cafeteria). Standouts are the the Dan Dan noodles and the hot pot !
I love the Han Dynasty in University City. I gave this location two tries and I am very disappointed with their quality. I got the veg lo mein and scallion pancakes. The veg lo mein was inedible and just had a weird smell to it! The scallion pancakes was ok. I won't be returning to this location! Get the chef from University City there's a huge inconsistency in taste specially for a chain restraunt!
Talk about disappointment! I've heard this place hyped up for so long, and I love me some Chinese food, so when I saw them on Caviar I had to capitalize. However, what ended up happening was I spent about $30 for delivery of what tasted like very basic bitch Chinese food and spring rolls that tasted like they came out of my grocer's freezer. 
I was expecting, for the price and hype, something much better than your corner Chinese joint. But honestly I think I prefer my local Chinese place. 
I got garlic chicken and rice with medium spice, but sadly there was no spice to be had. It tasted just like hunan chicken that I have sampled from a few local establishments. The spring rolls aren't even worth mentioning because they were so lame. 
I still hold out hope that the other location is a better experience, and perhaps once the sting of this disappointment wears away I will try.
First things first, this place is worth the wait.  We knew we were in for a wait so we went on a Saturday night at about 830.  The restaurant is BYOB without a corking fee.   The waitstaff is friendly and helpful. We will be going back there without a question in my mind.  

We ordered (with the intention of having leftovers) dan dan noodles, dumplings in chili oil, garlic style chicken, and hot sauce style pork.  

The spice level was not quite what I expected.  If you like spice and tolerate it well, take their spice level and subtract 3 from it.  So a 10 is really a 7 and a 3 is really nothing.
I would rather say 2 and 1/2 stars because I really love Han Dynasty but perhaps the Powelton Village and Olde City locations I've liked better. 

The Dan Dan noodles while still consistently chewy and spicy definitely lacked pork in the sauce. I literally had a bit of pork here and there. That was disappointing.  The cucumbers and dumplings were good and my companion and I liked the fact that the kitchen allowed her (picky ass) to sub ingredients. She winded up with a garlic sauce tofu dish that she enjoyed.

We also ordered take out and I had to lose some stars here as well. Despite asking for an extra side of brown rice to go along with the two "to go" entrees it was never packed with the order. And instead of putting the "to go" on a separate check it was totaled with our dine in order which completely hiked the tip up. Despite this Han is still a good bet.
Chili sauce. Chili sauce. Must get the wontons in chili sauce.

Everything was great. Recommend getting some appetizers, noodles and an entree and sharing
Tried the Manayunk location this time around. It's not as big as the one in the city. 
Food was also delicious here. The only thing is that they got our spice levels wrong. A lot of the dishes weren't as spicy as we requested. For instance, we asked for 8/10 spice level but instead the dish was made to be 4/10 level. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but not having the spice took points from a meal like dandan noodles.
