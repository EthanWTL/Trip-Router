The ratings for this place are an absolute Joe-k. It's a five-star spot if ever there were one. Along with John's Roast Pork, Nick's Old Roast Beef, and Miller's Twist/Smuckers inside Reading Terminal Market, it should be at the very top of your Philly must-try list. I'm glad I Joes to eat here because after Joes one bite, I was feeling Joesvial and with as much manergy (my word) as Indiana Joes or Keanu as Joes Wick.

What to get: Cheesesteak, Banana Shake (w Vanilla), Chocolate Shake. Use the pickle/pepper bar at the back.

Pat's or Geno's claim to be the King of steaks, but the only thing they are the King of is overpriced bland crap with neon signs that are far more enjoyable to look at than their products are to eat. Gooey Louie's, Jim's, Cosmo's, a little better. D'Alessandro's, John's Roast Pork, significantly better. But none of them come anywhere remotely near Joe's... Joe's should be the "King" of Cheesesteaks. And I'm not Joe King. At all.

Joe's is simply the best cheesesteak in the country. There may be delicious variations of it, here and there, but when it comes to the traditional Philly Cheesesteak, these guys have it down to perfection. Better even that John's Roast Pork's version... and regardless, John's is better for Roast Pork anyway - you'd never have guessed by the name, right?

So why is it the best? Well the meat tastes good, and not so processed. It's nice and steak-y. The bread is excellent. Cheese goes well. Onions. Add all the pickles and peppers that you want, to jazz it up. It just all comes together and works better than other local cheesesteaks do.

But there's another reason why you should come here. An even better reason. The decor is adorable and brightly-colored. Okay no, that's not it either. But seriously... One of the servers is like, a Victoria's Secret Angel who forgot to go to the photoshoot and came here to take sandwich orders instead. (Swoon).

Okay, no, that's not the better reason, although everything I just said is true, and she is totally amazing.

The better reason is the milkshakes! Omgz! I'm really picky when it comes to milkshakes, and I have to say, these pricy but enormous shakes are some of the best I've had anywhere! I had both the chocolate and the banana (made with vanilla), and each shake was absolute, thick, delicious heaven. The Chocolate was dreamy and creamy and luscious, while the banana had thick chunks of fresh banana mixed in with delicious vanilla goodness. I couldn't choose between them, because they were both so good (kind of like my two most recent girlfriends).

So get down here as quick as you can. They're far from just your average Joe's. It's important that you make the right decision when there's so much at Steaks.
Joe's FISHTOWN is the dream come true for the owner, a guy who grew up working in a well known cheesesteak place in business for over 60 years in the Northeast. He now owns that one and this one in FISHTOWN. 
It's a dream for patrons too. 

It's Turquoise tile, orange front door, neon signage and curved front architecture is warm and welcoming along Girard by day. At night, the energy of its "Joes Steaks and Soda" neon sign  lures you in even more.  
Inside is nicely decorated  in relaxing 1950'ish tones and signage along with comfy booths and tables. Every time I've gone I've been very warmly greeted and made to feel like they really wanted my business

I've only had the cheesesteak's but I have to tell you they're fabulous. Lots of good quality steak cut in long strips and served on the best rolls. There are plenty of toppings to add and the mushrooms I choose were freshly sliced and cooked to perfection. The way they sauté the onions is a nice touch too.
Their milkshakes and egg creams are reminiscent of those great ones served in luncheonettes along Girard Avenue in the 1960's. Today, I was in heaven with my vanilla egg cream.  

Now for the pièce de résistance - do not forget the pickle bar in the back. The waitstaff usually remind you but here's an additional reminder. It's stocked with really good pickles, and peppers With little containers if you decide to takeout. 

I'll be back !
tl;dr a reliable and authentic cheesesteak option in the Fishtown neighborhood, also dishing out some sweet shakes

Established in 1949, Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop feels like a blast from the past. With a menu featuring cheesesteaks and ice cream floats, Joe's comes as close to a malt shop as anywhere in Philly, barring Franklin Fountain. Even the outdoor area has character, decked out with neon orange metal chairs, baby-blue brick walls, and blasting pop music. Your steak is customizable in size (6" and 10"), cheese variety (whiz, provolone, or American), and toppings (mushrooms and fried eggs, to name a few).

My partner and I swung by Joe's during a recent bike ride to Fishtown and opted for two steaks and a shake. Ordering was easy from the takeout window, and food is made-to-order with only a short queue even at peak lunch hour on the weekends. The cheesesteak was Pat's/Geno's-esque in style, generously stuffed with toppings. While Joe's sturdy hoagie rolls surely outmatched the limp varieties at lesser establishments, I sorely missed the seeded rolls that define the top tier of Philly steaks. I appreciated the sandwich not feeling overwhelmingly greasy, but it erred on the side of being slightly too dry -- I ended up asking for some ketchup, which fixed it right up. On the other hand, the milkshake was a star, if not mildly overpriced (right around $7 for a grande-sized cup). Our "Muddy Sneakers" was a vanilla base loaded with caramel, chocolate chips, and peanut butter -- an uber-rich dessert for even the most dogged sweet-tooth.

While it probably won't knock your socks off, Joe's is a solid and (at $10 for a 10" steak) reasonably affordable cheesesteak-ery. While this isn't a place worth a trip out of my way, it definitely is an ideal neighborhood joint -- I have yet to encounter a better cheesesteak option in Fishtown.
I had never had a philly cheesesteak before coming to Philadelphia...so to say that my hopes were really high would be an understatement. Joe's was reasonably crowded on a Saturday night - an unpretentious, family friendly restaurant that boasts an enormous sandwich menu, a large variety of french fries (regular, Old Bay, buffalo chicken, etc) - most coming with a side of cheese whiz. They also had a huge shakes and specialty drinks menu. 

I ordered the classic small cheesesteak with American, and a small Old Bay Fries. My companion had the large cheeseteak, also with American. The sandwich had sauteed onions on it. What I found weird is that when they said American cheese, it was white - I'm used to the good ole Kraft single, and was pleasantly surprised that it was much tastier than what I had thought. 

The food was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. We were so full after dinner we had to go back and nap it up so we could get ready for the rest of the night. I would TOTALLY eat here again!
Third tier steaks in Philly. I liked the steak with whiz and onions, but the bread was stale. The dressed steak with provolone was super tough, dry, and tasted a little bit nasty like everything had been sitting around for a couple days. The other Joe's location is probably my favorite steak in Philly. Oh well.
Oh man these guys just moved up in my rankings in where to get a great cheesesteak. I think I qualify as an aficionado in this department seeing I've had a few here and there. Nothing better than a 1400 calorie induced cheesy meat filled goodness to set the mood my friends.  

For all you tourists who come to Philly hitting up Genos, Pat's and Jims keep on going there for that sub par crap. True Philadelphians know where the best quality is at, and Joe's you're a part of it.     

I LOVE a great steak joint, that doesn't need the all those advertisements  that others depend on. Joe's (formerly known as Chinks) has been doing it right ever since he opened up his first shop in 1949 in the great North East part of the city. His second location has been around since 2015 in Fishtown has been killing it like a boss there too. 

What makes a great sammy? Some say it's the ingredients and prep work. Others say its the establishment  and traditions behind it. My friends it is all about that bread, the foundation behind it. That is where you start this masterpiece, and Joe's has it my friends. Yes the tradition is important, and they follow it to the "T" but it starts with the choice of bread. 

Picture this kiddies, fresh sliced rib-eye waiting to be thrown on that grill. Perfect marbleized cut after cut of that rib-eye will give you that great flavor with every bite. Now that I gave you somewhat of a visual of the quality type of meat to expect, lets go a little further. Biting into your masterpiece will put a sense of fulfillment, knowing that quest for a perfect top notch sandwich has been found. What better way to wash this down? Order their chocolate coke for the win. You're welcome.

In closing Joe's gives you another reason why one should visit the Fishtown area.

With kind regards

Okay, I am guilty of not going out of my way to try authentic philly cheesteaks. Usually, when I have a craving I'll just stop at a pizzeria and take their version of it. This has got to stop! 

I was in the area and needed a quick meal before heading over to a nearby bar. We split a large cheesesteak, they are not lying when they say large! The bread was fresh and soft yet able to hold all of that cheesey meat without falling apart. An added bonus was the selection of flavored cokes. It took me back to my younger days when my favorite after school meal was a cheesesteak and Vanilla Coke. Another added bonus was the condiment bar. I loved pickles and these were beyond amazing. Somehow, I had never added them to my cheesesteak. It was a match made in Joe heaven! 

The restaurant is on the small side but I loved the retro feel. We were seated right away and our food brought out quickly. The service was overall friendly. I am dying to comeback and have my cheesesteak and Coke combo or maybe shaking it up a little with a milkshake.
Great find while visiting a customer in Philadelphia. Thank you Yelp for sending me to Joe's.
Super reasonable prices for High Quality Steaks. The bread is fresh and crispy, the Steak is tender and cooked perfectly, the sautéed onions and mushrooms add the needed favors and the masterpiece is completed with Cheese Whiz. The pickle bar is included and offers pickles, hot peppers and condiments. The French fries were so so but were easily recovered with a side of Cheese Whiz. Service is great, there are approximately 8 booths and a few community tables. The seats are for diners opting for table service only. If you place the order at the counter, the food is to be taken to go. Parking can be tough depending on the time of day.
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and will be back the next time I am in the area.
Came here on a recommendation from a friend for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't packed at all and the waitress told us to sit anywhere (we were a party of 4)

We each ordered a large cheesesteak and a side of cheese fries and old bay fries.  I ordered mine with a combo of provolone and whiz, onions, and mushrooms. I probably would've been better off just getting whiz since I didn't really taste the provolone. Anyways the cheesesteak was DELICIOUS!! The bread was so soft and just the right amount to balance with the steak. The steak itself was hot and soft to chew.  The fried onions were so sweet - I wish I could've asked for extra!

The fries were crispy and a good portion for a group of 4. The old bay fries were on point and when we dipped it into the side of whiz, it was heavenly!

I also love the condiment section to the back of the restaurant - you can get whatever condiment fix you want and lots of it!!!  

Also I heard lots of reviews about their shakes so I couldn't leave without one! Ordered a black and white shake (my fav) to go and it was delicious and thick just the way I like it.

Overall we will definitely come back - love this place!
Why anyone would decide to order cheesesteaks from the tourist traps around the Liberty Center (minus Sonny's), or on 9th Street is beyond me where there are places like Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop.  

I am not the biggest fan of the cheesesteak but, when I get the hankering for one I want it done right. My first cheesesteak from Joe's told my stomach and taste-buds that they had a home here. Beware! My friend and I are two individuals that have no trouble putting away food, but we were hitting the wall near the end. The meat is chopped right, the bread soft and fresh, and just plain ole goodness at every bite. 

My friends and I decided to order pumpkin-pie milkshakes. They choose to enjoy them with their cheesesteaks, I requested to have mine made at the end of our service to go. If you think you don't have the room for a milkshake... order one anyway! When the waitress came back to the table she had four glasses of BAM!! That's 4 glass of Big A$$ Milkshakes. These were no runny liquid milkshakes. The milkshakes were blended to a thick consistency where a spoon was almost required.  In regards to flavor, the milkshakes were good. 

I will be back to check out the other items on the menu and if I have the time to make the trek to Fishtown when my cheesesteak hankering comes calling.
When you're tasked with taking someone to try their first cheesesteak you have to factor in avoiding the tourists traps, go with one of the names that carry a storied reputation, and close enough other places and activities that you may enjoy throughout the day.

For all of the above the Fishtown branch of Joe's is the perfect destination, and it lives up to the legacy that the Torresdale one has held onto for the past six decades (despite its unfortunate original name). The steaks are all huge, reasonably priced, and feature plenty of topping options (don't go for too many though since there's also the pepper & pickle bar for unlimited customization. So much so that if service didn't have its spotty moments it would have been a perfect five.

Another winning advantage to Joe's is the variation of the menu, as it has options that go well over the typical cheesesteak places. You can still get the incredible fries, chicken cheesesteaks (and veggie and vegan). But here you can also grab burgers, hot sausage, buffalo chicken fries, and some incredible milkshakes.
Honestly, so many cheesesteak joints garner acclaim solely on their name, rather than on taste or quality. However, Joe's has resisted any drop in such quality by continuing to serve up a superb steak sandwich. Huge portion size, good flavor, and perfectly cooked chopped onions (a true litmus test of mine). I also was also digging the throwback homage to the 1950's. Good spot in Fishtown!
Food aside, Joe is an incredibly compassionate business owner who sincerely cares about the patrons at his establishment. My iPhone was stolen when I was here earlier this week, and Joe did not rest until he figured out exactly what happened to it, and recovered it for me. I was in awe at how much time and effort he spent on this, and I am definitely in a very small minority of people that have a phone stolen, be missing for days, and get it back in perfect condition. Thank you Joe, for being a stand-up example of a business owner, and just a great human. 

I will support this place and tell everyone I know to do the same. Plus, they have a vegan steak, crinkle fries, and a huge pickle bar!!
Not a huge cheesesteak person (yes, that's pretty unheard of for being a Philly girl, I know) but decided to give Joe's a whirl after a night on the town. 

Thankfully we beat the crazy 2am Friday rush of people but the place was still pretty crowded when we arrived closer to 1:30am. There is some booth style seating but not a whole lot so it might not be such a bad idea to do take out. The counter is right by the entrance so needless to say it did get pretty cramped and chaotic at times. 

My friend and I split a cheesesteak with friends and a medium fountain soda. Little pricey considering the meal came out to $20. All in all, it was pretty good. I especially liked the thick cut fries. The portion sizes were fairly big.

Don't care for traditional cheesesteaks? Don't worry, Joe's has plenty of alternatives including chicken cheesesteaks and sandwiches, hot dogs, grilled cheeses, and even veggie burgers! The pizza fries sound pretty intriguing. I'd definitely consider ordering them next time.
YUM! This place was walking distance from our AirBnB and boy was I blown away. 

LOCATION: It's on the corner of sort of a main street. There's no outside seating but the inside has plenty of space. The look this place has is like a 50s diner almost. It's clean and well kept, it almost looks new! 

SERVICE: We didn't have to wait long for our food. The waitress was attentive and didn't give us grief for splitting the check like 5 different ways. 

FOOD: The oreo milkshake. OMG. Blew me away. I got a Philly cheese with gooey cheese wiz. I know the name sounds funny but trust me - it's delicious. The cheese is so rich that it almost sticks to your lips lol 

Will I come back? Yeah! 
Will I recommend this place? For sure. 
Why didn't it get a 5? Well, I still like Geno's better :)
If you're looking to ruin your workout with a decadent and satisfying meal, Joe's is worth every cheesy calorie. The keys is to come hungry - and don't think too much about it.

I came here for National Cheesesteak Day (because there's a day for that, apparently). There weren't any specials or discounts, but that didn't stop me from going whole hog. There is a pretty vast menu given the retro simplicity of their small, packed location. Remember what I said a few sentences ago? Don't think about it. Order what your heart desires. You can't go wrong with their classic cheesesteak, in 6" or 10", with any combination of American, Provolone, and/or Whiz. In my opinion, Joe's offers one the better cheesesteaks in the city. Top it off with a shared order of crinkle cut fries (and cheese on the side, duh) and a specialty soda (free refills!) or milkshake. The only bad decision is depriving your stomach from what it wants. While I wouldn't eat here frequently, because it's just SO heavy, rich, and caloric, it's truly a treat to my sodium and sugar obsessed palate. Wear your stretchy pants.

The prime real estate on the corner of Girard and Frankford in Fishtown combined with their long hours of operation (open until 3AM on Fridays and Saturdays!) make this a popular food stop. It's never NOT busy, but some times are busier than others. If you're lucky, you can grab a booth or table. You can also take it home or across the street to Garage Fishtown, a bar that encourages you to "Bring Your Own Cheesesteak." The trolley and MFL drop you right where you need to be, but parking nearby is a toss-up.
Joe's Steaks is a great addition to the NoLibs/Fishtown dining scene.  It is right in the heart of all the action at Frankford & Girard.  The owners have done a great job in retroing it to a Malt Shop look (indeed they offer up Malts).  The host greeting you when you entered was really friendly and helpful.

The cheesesteaks are of excellent quality and they have the best hot sauce, pepper and pickle bar to add to your sandwich in the city. This is also one of the few famous cheesesteak places in Philly with indoor seating - think rainy days and wintertime.  And they are also open late on the weekends so a pit stop on the way home from the nearby pubs may be just what the potential hangover ordered!
For both pre-shelter-at-home dining in and quarantine take out, Joe's has always been there for me when other places weren't. I was hard pressed to find a cheesesteak on my drive from DC to NY and thankfully Joe's offered contact-less pick up. Now that dine in is gone, there's not much to say aside from the taste is consistent and that there's a nice line of people outside waiting for their orders. One downside to not being able to walk in, is the elimination of the hot pepper bar. I always get the same thing: cheesesteak, mushrooms, wiz. Easy as that. Boyfriend often goes for onions on the cheesesteak and cheese fries to up the ante. Don't count on going for an early morning run the day after!
I have to say it pains me a bit to write this review. I have been a long time customer if Joe's place on Torresdale Ave. I was recently in the area and decided to grab a quick sandwich. This location is an old diner and much larger and roomier than the Torresdale location. They do offer the same menu with some added options.

I arrived Sunday around 9:00 and it was fairly busy. They have a closing time listed as 10:00. The cooks were getting so mad every time someone walked in, just shaking their heads and making smart comments. That's not good for business nor, does it come off well. Anyway i decided on a mushroom cheesesteak and fries. My cheesesteak was nowhere near as good as the original spot. The meat was extremely overcooked and they were very skimpy with the mushrooms. The roll as always was very fresh. The fries were also disappointing and soggy. 

Sadly I will not return to this location. I will just stick to the original spot. 2 stars...
This while overall experience was a disaster. I came to Philly from Baltimore and came to Joe's to get a sub before the drive home. Upon arriving at 2:20 AM, we were told by the security officer at the door that we couldn't enter because they were done taking orders for the night, although we walked 30 minutes to get there in the pouring down rain and their website says they stay open until 3. After being let in after 20 minutes of standing in the rain, I was harassed and threatened by a group at a table in the back. A kid started making fun of me amongst his friends in private at the table, only I heard him and he didn't know. I said something so him about what he said and he started to threaten me and ask what i would do about it.. I responded and while doing so was told that I had to leave the restaurant. This kid tried to embarrass me and then fight me and then when I replied and stood up for myself in a non confrontational matter, I was forced to leave. All staff working tonight should be embarrassed for themselves and should be fired. I've never felt more uncomfortable in a setting in my life.
Who serves up the best Cheesesteak in Philly is a debate that ever rages on. I've been fortunate enough to try more than a handful of them including Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's, Dalessandro's but I think I've found my favorite in Philly: Joe's Steak and Soda Shop. This retro institution is a blast from the past served on an Italian roll reminiscent of The Happy Days set from the vintage soda fountain down to the wooden booths. The steaks are sliced in-shop rather than unwrapped and defrosted on the grill making them fresher than most of the competition. The egg creams, malts, shakes and soda floats are made with Turkey Hill Ice Cream and unique custom soda flavors.
I was at Joe's after a night out with friends in Fishtown.  We arrived somewhere around 2am I believe.  The line was long but nothing too crazy.  At most of the well known cheesesteak spots they pump out the steaks and the line moves quickly.... not on this night at Joe's.  The guy making the steaks was slow to say the least and didn't look like he wanted to be there(I can't blame him).  

When my name was called I grabbed my large double meat steak (prov, onions).  One bright spot about Joe's was the size of the steak and the amount of meat in each one.  I definitely did not need to get the double meat.  The flavor was lacking and didn't compare to John's or Steve's.  All in all I would say the steak was average and I would stop in again if I was out late but wouldn't make this a sober meal.
So, I was told that when in Philly, I should have a cheesesteak at Geno's or Pat's... but, I was nowhere near them and Joe's was within walking distance, so easy decision. I have had cheesesteaks in other cities, but there's a certain allure about having a food known for being from a certain city in that city. I had a regular cheeseteak but I screwed it up in my amateruness (is that a word?) and ordered it with Provolone instead of Cheez Whiz! I have failed you Philly... I have failed you. =D

Anyway, the sandwich was AMAZEBALLS! I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I was eating in Fishtown or it was just really that good, but I loved every bite. I had an order of the Old Bay fries which were nice and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and very well seasoned.

If I am ever in Fishtown again (doubtful, but in case) I will have it with Cheez WHiz!
Joe's was highly recommended to me from a friend. My buddy and I were in town and stopped by. This joint was jumping when we arrived. Joe's is different than most of the other cheesesteak shops in town as it's a sit down place. 

We waited about 15 minutes for a table. One thing I thought was cool is that they make their own sodas. Our server appeared quickly after we were seated. I ordered a cheesesteak and a side of fries seasoned with Old Bay. My friend got the same thing.

The food arrived quickly and it was steaming hot! The sandwich was stuffed with meat and had a good amount of cheese. The side of fries was ginormous. The cheesesteak was excellent. The meat was juicy and actually seasoned which most places don't do and it pisses me off lol. The bread was crusty and chewy. I loved the crinkle cut fries seasoned with Old Bay. They were so good and freaking addicting. 

I enjoyed Joe's. The cheesesteak was one of the better ones that I've had in the city and I've had a lot a lot of them lol. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Philly.
This cheesesteak was inedible. It's bread was unusual, the meat looked bad.  It was very dry, dried up tasteless.

I asked for whiz-but please just put it on the roll, so it does not just get dumped and poured all over the top of the sandwich. They said no problem, then did the exact opposite. It was terrible.
They have a pickle bar in the back, where you could add your own hot peppers. The young kid working there started pushing my friend and I around while at the pickle bar, bumping him and even talking trash to us- extremely rude comments.
For example- my friend used a new plastic fork from the stand to pull pickles out of their metal bins. After using a fork to sanitarily take a few (rather than just fish and scoop out pickle slices with our hands?),and then set it down, this kid starts telling him things also, like " oh sure, ya just throw your trash anywhere".  My friend grew visibly irritated. It was a terrible experience all around. I decided to make it known- I honestly couldn't eat such a poor quality sandwich there anyways, having been spoiled by Jim's and John's for years.

Upon telling the manager that we were knocked and his busser didnt say 'excuse me', made further comments to my friend, and more importantly my meal was not prepared as I asked (these are easy to prepare tiny $10 sandwiches), he did not make any apology nor any attempt to correct the issue.
I then asked to get a refund and said i wanted the owner to call me if he could not do that.
Manager said " Get the __ out of my restaurant"

I hope this Yelp! Review reaches many people looking for good a good cheesesteak in Philadelphia- there are literally hundreds of better ones! This place is not worth their slop food, nor their slop attitudes. Save your money and go anywhere else!
Worth the hype!  Shared a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms, fries, and a vanilla shake with my son.  The fries and shake were good - but really - you're there for the cheesesteak - which was fantastic.  We took it back to our hotel, but waited in the restaurant while it was prepared.  The restaurant decor is super cute - kind of old fashioned dinerish and clean.  There's a pickle bar in the back with various sauces and pickled items.  The service was efficient and everyone was friendly.
Located right next to the bars, this is definitely a good place to grab late night eats. 

It was really busy when we came in late Saturday night but service was fast and friendly.
The cheese fries were amazing. I'd recommend this place for tourists craving a cheese steak & in the area.
Being from Philly, I have naturally tried almost every cheesesteak spot in the city (Genos, pats, Johns, Tony Luke's, Jims, delassandros, etc...y'all get the point haha) but there are a few, Joes included, that I still had not tried. I say all that to say, I'm very critical of a good cheesesteak.

So, I ordered a large cheesesteak with cheese whiz , (of course)black pepper, Mayo and ketchup, and the old bay fries with a side of cheese whiz. From the start of the order, one difference i noticed was Joes does not put the condiments (black pepper, Mayo, ketchup) on the sandwich for you. They are given on the side. Not a huge deal but definitely a difference from majority of other places but I can see how customers may want to add these items themselves. 

I ordered to go and when I left I noticed they forgot to add a side of cheese whiz for the fries. Having to go back and get it was not convenient but hey it happens and the staff was super nice in giving me the side. 

Onto the food. The fries were VERY good. Not overly seasoned and the cheese whiz for the fries and sandwich was probably the best whiz I've had on a steak. Not sure what the added ingredients may have been but it was GOOD! The cheesesteak had enough meat, and the roll was fresh and withheld the sandwich (meaning the bread did not get soggy). My only, not so good thing to point out was the meat was very tough to chew through at certain points. I like my steak chopped a little more fine.

But all and all this was a good spot. Happy I tried it and will definitely come back in the future.
I came to Philly today to perform so i decided that I wanted to order a cheesesteak for the experience. I ordered a cheesesteak with provolone cheese, raw onions, mushrooms, pickles, whole peppers, and a side of whiz! My sandwich only came with steak, onions, mushrooms, and provolone cheese. There was NO pickles, peppers, or side of whiz in the bag! I had to scrape off the whiz from my friends sandwich paper. This was the worst first experience and I would like a refund because I paid extra for those toppings!!! I will post the picture of my sandwich along with the receipt.
Take out order: 
First time ordering from here and it definitely did not disappoint. Good flavor and they're very generous with the amount of steak in the large cheese steak with whiz and fried onions. Glad we decided to give this place a try. Nice to not have to go to the typical well known places in Philly since this is closer to home. 
Food was picked up at the window, not sure if that is  typical but quick and clean transaction. Will definitely recommend and return again. 
Street parking. 
Very good service.
If you're VEGAN, beware of this place!!! After ordering a vegan cheesesteak, my waitress tried to pass off a real cheesesteak as the  vegan option. After repeatedly ( 3 times to be exact) asking her if she was sure the cheesesteak she passed me was vegan, she changed her story x3 times. One time saying she gave my friend and I received the wrong check. The second time stating that she mistakenly wrote it down as a regular cheesesteak, but let the cooks know it was vegan, and then finally said that she had swapped the checks with another table by mistake. All of which were a lie. As someone who hasn't eaten meat in 14 years, this is really disappointing. Don't try to cover up the fact you made a mistake by lying. Not cool Joe's Steaks! I would have really appreciated honesty in the mistake instead of the coverup. I won't be coming back, and will definitely be urging my friends to do the same. Cause if I was lied about the cheesesteak; what else are you lying about?
I was only in Philly for one day and heard great things about this place, so I had to go check it out. As soon as I came in, I was greeted by a friendly waitress who handed me the menu. Unfortunately, that good start turned sour almost immediately. Two couples that came in after me got their orders taken before I did - one of them by the same waitress that handed me the menu and that said she'd "be right back." To make matters worse, two OTHER waitresses that were merely walking around the place (it wasn't busy at all) walked up to the two couples (who had received their drinks before I had even been asked for my order) and asked them how they were doing. Uh, hello?! I'm sitting here by myself on an empty table (no water or anything), looking at you in the face, and you ignore me completely? When my original waitress finally came to my table--about TEN minutes after she took the order of the SECOND couple that came in AFTER me--she said "Sorry, they just thought I took your order when you came in." Huh? Who is "they?" And what does it matter who "they" are? YOU knew you hadn't taken my order and there is no possible way that you and/or your coworkers couldn't have noticed me, as the place is pretty small. 

What else went wrong? Even though I asked for my milkshake with my cheesesteak, they gave to me about 10 minutes before my cheeseteak arrived. When it finally did, the shake was watery as hell, and on top of that, the sandwich had barely any meat. 

One small positive, though: one of the busboys smiled at me as he cleaned the table next to mine, and I couldn't help but think it was some sort of act of solidarity towards the only other PoC there. I didn't notice that I was the only non-white person in the place until that happened, and although I'm not one to shout "RACISM!" whenever I receive less than stellar treatment, it does make you wonder if that might have been an issue.

In conclusion: customer service SUCKS in this place, and the food isn't anything to write home about either. Avoid!
$9.99 full cheesesteak out the door! They have a pickle/pepper bar which is pretty sweet. Gave it 4/5 bc I haven't eaten enough food here but I do know it wasn't PERFECT PERFECT.
I don't know what has happened to this place in the last 3 or so months but wow complete waste of money now. This use to be the best gf cheesesteak and now it is pure laziness with their food. Doesn't taste good anymore and it isn't put together well (see photo). I have given it multiple extra chances but I'm done now. No more. Don't waste your time with this place.
Came here after a night at the bar across the street. It was so crowded! Drunk kids everywhere but the cheese steak was worth it.
This was everything what I hoped and dreamed I would find in Philly. An ooey gooey cheesesteak loaded with tasty steak, whiz and onions. Messy. Many napkins sacrificed. Small size was plenty big enough for 1.

Pickle/pepper bar in the back - the round peppers are HOT. Loved the cherry soda too. Cheese fries were piping hot but the whiz did get thick after it cooled. Someone had gotten the old bay fries which were a bit over salted. Tried my friend's shake - perfect!

Only waited a couple minutes to be seated. Not overly crowded and no line. There is a seperate takeout counter. Dining here left me satisfied and smiling.
I love down the road so I visit this place 2x a week.  Besides 1 factor, this place gets a 4.6, which could be rounded up to a 5. However,  there are some issues.  

First, let's go over the pros:
1- perfectly sliced steak
2-great and  creative milkshakes
3- pickle bar
4- good bread (like any other respectable place in philly)


Cons:
1-consistency- depending on which staff is on, you could have an entirely different experience. Wait times, customer attention, even quantity of cheese wiz 

2- posted hours!- they have posted hours but the staff tries to cheat.  I showed up at 220am on Friday only to be told that they were closing (posted is 3am).  After prodding, I was told that there were too many people in the establishment.  I can swear on my my great grandmothers grave that they had at least 4x the amount people in the establishment 3 hours before.  This comes down to laziness.  I can't stress how stupid it is to say your open until X only to refuse service 40 minutes before X.  Just change your posted hours!  Absolutely horrible!!
So glad to have Joe's Steaks in the neighborhood. Along with Paesano's, the Fishtown/NoLibs area is finally getting some real sandwich street cred. 

We stopped at Jim's and Joe's in the same Saturday. Granted, we hit Jim's midday, sober, and waited in line 15 minutes to eat solid-but-nothing-special steaks. Then, 8 hours later and fully of Brody's amazing cocktails from Fette Sau, we stopped at Joe's on our way home. And they knocked it out of the park. 

Our steak (whiz with) was fast, hot, large, and loaded with tons of perfectly cooked meat and onions. Plenty of whiz, but not overwhelming, and the roll was perfect. Not a super-soft Amoroso's. It had a bit more tooth and flavor of it's own. 

I'll have to make up an excuse to get back to try the malted and burgers, but I am thrilled to have a legit cheesesteak place in the neighborhood. Also, extra credit for completely rehabbing a corner in Fishtown. Beautiful shop and friendly staff.
I felt pretty medium about this place. I usually say it's hard to tell steaks from one another but this place has a distinct taste- neither good nor bad just different. The bread had a harder shell than I've normally found- neither good nor bad just different. Didn't try the soda but watched how they are made- 2 large pumps of flavor syrup- seems to give it good flavor. Service was good. I always love a good pickle bar which they had. Overall... just eh? It was fine.
boy oh boy. I want to love this place, but waiting almost 45 minutes for a steak sandwich in a near empty restaurant is a real bummer. understandably they just opened, but the staff was in a total cluster fuck all just standing around very unorganized. Not sure if take-out will be a little easier, but for the cost you'd think it be a little better customer service.
Was here when they first opened and was much more impressed.  This second visit was terrible.  Place is packed on a Monday night as if they were giving it away!  The steak was packed with meat... problem was it was tasteless and slices so thinly that you could hardly chew it. Had to keep adding salt and Peter as well as ketchup with every bite.

I don't like a diced up steak sandwich.  The cheese fries were cold and limp.  Not crispy or crunchy.

This place is definitely the "Chink's" we all remember... God rest it's soul.  Chink must be rolling over in his grave.
stopped in at this place Saturday night after a few too many beers at Ortlieb's.  

I had always heard great things about this place in the Northeast, but I am not driving up there for anything, so was glad they opened in my hood.

Now, I am not really a cheesesteak guy, cuz real Philly is all about the roast pork sandwich. But this place definitely blows Pat's or Geno's-- or any of the million corner stores making steaks-- out of the water. Only thing I have had that even approaches the quality I found here would be Tony Luke's (but if I am at Tony Luke's, I am getting a pork sandwich with rabe and long hots.)

Not sure what all the posted complaints re: bad service are about, because our food came in like 5 minutes, tops. And this was in the midst of a Saturday night rush. lots of people.The service was very good, the waitress, counter person, and cooks were all really friendly even though it was 2am on a Saturday night and they were slammed.

The restaurant was spotlessly clean, as were the bathrooms--and it didn't have that horrible gross rotten cheese steak smell like the places on South street pump out.

We had two steaks with provolone and a chocolate malt.

The roll was fantasic, they said it was Liscio's bread, which makes sense, it wasn't gummy, had a real crust, excellent, toasted perfectly, I could eat that alone with some butter and it would be good to soak up the Kenzingers.

Meat was high quality, not gristle, no weird stuff in it, not too fatty, just good. Not cheap corner hoagie shop garbage.

I had tomatoes and lettuce on mine, that stuff was fresh too, very good.

If I had any complaints about the sandwich, I would say it was slightly under seasoned and needed more cheese.   I just added a little salt to my steak and it was fine--better to have to do this than have it be too salty I guess. Next time, I will order double cheese and see if that fixes the cheese issue. 

Our malt was a little under "malted" but that is because I ordered a shake at first and then realized they had malts and asked them to make it a malt after the fact, so I think they couldn't put too much malt powder in since it was already on the machine.

Typically, about three minutes after I eat a cheesesteak in Philly, I regret it, start feeling ill, hate myself for eating crappy junk food. I often say "never doign that again!" I had no such reaction to the Joe's Steak, it was awesome.  Just good food, good ingredients. Will definitely hit this place for late night food or any time I am not getting a hoagie at Fran's or a pork sammie at Paesano's. 

This was hands down the best cheesesteak I have ever had in Philly.

And it soaked up the beers very well. 

Now, here is my only real complaint--and the only reason I didn't give Joe's 5 stars. This place opened at Frankford and Girard, in the midst of the madness of northern liberties, kenzo, Fishtown, and it has NOT A SINGLE BIKE RACK. 

NOT ONE. 

This is unacceptable. Not having bike racks in this neighborhood is a cardinal sin. I remain amazed at any business that doesn't get this.  I know in the northeast you may not see a lot of riders, but down here everybody rides. You need bike racks.

Unless you want to send a "douche signal" to all the bike riders in the hood (like Stephen Starr at Frankford Hall, which still has no racks after several years open), Please INSTALL SOME BIKE RACKS. You have a corner property, with big sidewalks, you owe it to your customers to put in a couple racks.  

Take a walk down the street to Fishtown Tavern and check their racks out, or just look out your window and look at how many bikes are locked at Johnny Brenda's. 

YOU NEED YOUR OWN BIKE RACKS!

Other than that issue, I really have no complaints with Joe's.  I am glad they are there, the food lived up to the hype, and I saw none of the opening jitters the other reviewers have mentioned. 

I am looking forward to eating here again--but I hope I will be able to lock my bike securely in front of the place the next time.
Had you previously asked me where's the best place to grab a cheesesteak my answer would have been another philly staple UNTIL I tried Joe's.. their cheesesteaks are great! Just the right amount of cheese to onions to wiz ratio.. you can't go wrong here! No wonder they say they perfected the philly steak!! A++
An acquaintance mentioned this was his favorite cheesesteak in philadelphia so I was looking forward to trying. I sometimes eat cheesesteaks for breakfast--they hold the #1 place in my heart for hangover curing purposes. I made sure I got myself extra hungover to test properly. The results? The bread I am not a fan of....was dry and too *bready*. The cheesesteak served was a poor representation of what is available in philly. The spot is cool and casual! I have tried another time since the first time and stand by my bread comment.
What a perfect spot to get your late night food on after a night of drinking.  I loved the simple menu, the 1950's feel and the friendly staff. Not wanting to eat a whole cheesesteak we had the cheese dogs! They were amazing. About twice the size that I thought they were going to be and priced only at $2.75. It was more of a meal than a snack. They have a pickle bar and a fixings bar which is always fun for pickle aficionados. Made for some fun people watching as mostly 20 somethings got their food on.  Noticed that it is BYOB which is definitely a plus if you are looking for a nice place to start your evening!
Should be in the discussion of the best cheesesteak places in Philadelphia.  Consistently provides a well put together cheesesteak that isn't too sloppy or greasy.  Excellent fries and milkshakes as well.  The interior seems to have the feel of a '50s diner but I cannot say that with absolute certainty as I was not alive in the '50s.
I grew up with Joe's (chinks) and this place is obviously not the same as the OG. The food and service is not as good as the OG but it's not bad! The steaks and shakes are good and of course the pickle bar is great!
Joe's is an absolutely solid choice for a cheesesteak. It's on the top tier in Philadelphia. 

The meat is always seasoned well, as are the onions, and the rolls are soft, but not chewy. The milkshakes are so good as well. If you go, expect to be full after the meal. 

The fries are really good here, too! Thick crinkle-cut fries that are crispy and great when fresh.

Overall, this place, both locations, are top-notch for cheesesteaks. I'm a huge fan.
Haven't had many cheesesteaks in my life but this one makes me wanna have more! It was a mandatory experience during our 1 day visit and this place was a delicious experience. The meat is not ground but consists of thinly sliced strips, which makes it even better. Yum! The staff was friendly and provided prompt service. The bathrooms were kind of dirty but at least they have one.
Came to Philly for a day trip and ended it at this place. My friends and I had been eating all day but wanted to try multiple cheese steak places and this one was our favorite. We had the cheesesteak with cheese whiz. The cheese whiz is heavenly! I didn't want the sandwich to end. The shop is also nice, clean, and family friendly. Will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Philly.
WISH I could review Joes. Unfortunately I couldn't-, because after waiting in a very short line I was coaxed to a table where I was able to sample the Diet Coke and the pickle bar. I saw many cheesesteaks be served to those in line after me, but never received mine. Funny how after 40

Coke was great. Just the right amount of fizz. So there's that. 

What a disappointment.

We left. Our friends decided to give joes a second chance by waiting in line. So weird. Orders were

. Manager said we shouldn't have left in the first place. H! 

Don't bother. Place has no management. No responsibility. And no service.
The management here is terrible.  Things were chaotic inside.  They are probably violating labor laws because one waitress said she stayed to work for free because they were busy.  Of course she was also the one who kicked us out of the table because she said she will not get tip if we sat in the booth without ordering from them.  There wasn't any sign saying that we could only sit at tables or booth if we ordered from the waitress.  Certainly, the person who took our order didn't ask if we were dining in or not.  
These waitresses seen stressed and over worked and management is not helping them. 
One suggestion maybe they can have a sign or two at the tables or front saying the tables are only for dine in service.  That might help some confusion and plus the waitress will get the tip.  
We gave the waitress her tip for sitting at the booth for 10 mins.  

Cheesesteak is good but there are better places out there with better service and management.  They won't be getting my business anymore.
Terribly long waits. It took over an hour to get a take out order. The cheesesteaks are good, but not worth the wait.
Tried to go on a Saturday at 11:45am. Not sure why they are closed with staff just sitting around inside.
I will  say the new method has taken a told. Less people. 0 stars. Forced to one.
We mistook this place for a diner. We were looking for breakfast but they only had cheesesteak and eggs, as a breskfast type fare. It was pretty tasty, especially with optional toppings of onions and mushrooms. They also had a pickle bar which was awesome for us pickle lovers.
Milkshake was good, but we tried the vegetarian option and it wasn't the greatest tasting veggie cheesesteak I've had.
After several years of buying cheesesteaks from here, I am done. They no longer put onions and mushrooms on them. What a ripoff and it is false advertising. They now specialize in serving so-called food without flavor.

It even says on their menu that they put onions and mushrooms. Why lie??? 

DON'T call it a Philly cheesesteak if it is not.

One of the fails they produced was when I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, I arrived at work, and guess what was in my alleged Philly cheesesteak instead of mushrooms and onions? Lettuce and tomato. I threw it in the garbage. That was only ONE of the times they failed. Normally they just don't put onions and mushrooms.  Whenever I politely complain, they make sorry excuses with an attitude and they do not apologize.
No more walking to my local.
Ordered one small regular cheesesteak at the walk-up window and was told it'd be ten minutes. THIRTY minutes of standing on the sidewalk later I asked about the status again and it was still several orders away without any apology so I said to forget it and give me a refund. Guy standing next to me was waiting even longer. It takes a minute to toss some meat and cheese into a piece of bread so I don't know why service is so piss-poor for a basic fast food-type place with a full kitchen. I warned a couple about to get in line so they left, be sure to ask if you see several people waiting!
No taste. They don't cook the meat with peppers. Had to add the peppers, pickles, and Mayo myself on the tiny bread. Disappointing
At this location the meat is also flavorless, good thing it had plenty of cheez whiz to mask that fact, the fries were soft and definitely not worth the extra money for Old Bay.
Went here 3 time because their location is cute and I was told to give them multiple tries but 3 times is enough for me to not use the excuse "might've been an off day". They handle covid appropriately, their staff is super friendly and present, but the food just doesn't do it for me. If it wasn't for the strawberry milkshake (which was the best part of my meal, sadly..) I'd give 2 stars. I just couldn't fathom paying more than $20 for a dry cheesesteak and cold/stale fries.....
We ordered 8 vegan cheesesteaks on Goldbelly, which was super expensive, but we wanted a Philly. They were gross. It had the texture of chitterlings and it was very bland. We couldn't get the cheese to melt either. We wondering if they were even done. Well that was a huge waste of money because we won't be eating the rest. To the trash the other 7 go. SMH
Well I guess when you order a vegan steak, they require you to pick a cheese via Grubhub.  So I select and then select no cheese as clearly indicated on my ticket.  Open it up to find cheese.  When has reading become so hard?  Thanks for a wasted meal as I don't eat cheese on this.
Joe's was convenient stop at the end of our tour. Parking isn't easy in this area especially at night. Happens to be popular after midnight. 
Food trucks line the streets. Bar pouring with people. It was a great evening to chill. 

No line to order but the wait for a table was a different story. They hand us our table number. We stand until someone finishes eating right in the middle of the dining area. Very uncomfortable feeling, I'd say. Trying to figure out who is leaving first so the next people waiting doesn't take it. Took about 15 mins. 
Once we sat our food was brought to our table. The burger was good and a nice size, fries were nice and hot. 
Glad I was able to experience Joe's.
Joes steaks and soda shop will always be called Chinks to me. their milkshakes are simple and delicious and you can smell the cheesesteaks while walking up to the door. this is a iconic stop for anyone who's looking for a great philly cheesesteak. seating is very limited. not sure of there hours but I do believe they close early, the neighborhood isn't what it used to be.
I realize they've just opened, but the service is terrible. Waited close to an hour for a cheesesteak AFTER I ordered. Watched people after me get theirs while I waited. Perhaps they don't understand how to put orders in order, but then they mixed mine up to boot! The cheesesteak itself is fine and nothing to write home about, but let's hope they figure out the rest of it to at least match.
It is not a fluke..I repeat it is not a fluke.

This is the second time I have tried Joe's Steaks and they are tremendous. Seriously you do not have to travel all around the city searching for the best cheesesteak as once you reach this level of excellenence its really just spinning your wheels. If you are ever in the area of Fishtown this is the place for a A+ Cheesesteak. The seating can be very hard to come by and you MUST tell them when you order if you are dining in or not....or they will throw you out or politely ask you to leave if you sit down. And if you are a beer drinker I highly recommend you take your cheesesteak across the street to the Garagae bar where you can shoot some pool, play the jukebox, or order one of there beers (They have over 200 to choose from)

Cheers! And SYOY!!!
Cheesesteak was good just hard to find parking and its a young night crowd. If you don't mind being around drunk College students this is a cool place to go for a steak.
This is our go-to place for a quick cheesesteak!! We have tried multiple cheesesteak spots over the four years we have lived in philly, and we like how Joe's is fast, the meat is minced, and they put a good amount of cheese on there. My favorite is the cheesesteak with whiz and onions and mushrooms with an egg added to it. The 10 inch cheesesteak is huge and although I planned to save half for later, that never happened! It's a BYOB (my favorite) and there is an affordable ACME nearby that sells a variety of beer, or the Bottle Bar East which is more expensive but has more craft beer options. I always bring family here and they also loved it!
First off, I have to give a special shout-out to Yelper extraordinaire Fox E., who recommended this place over all the cheese-steak places in Philly. Which leads me to the point that there seems to be a war of such thing in that great city: who has the best cheese-steak? who founded the first one? which has more flavor? You get one side of the aisle saying Geno's is the best, while the other side says absolutely not. But Joe's was the winner, since it was in a good area outside downtown - plus it was on the way to my hotel. 

Service was very prompt and all the workers were awesome. After I ordered, they told me to help myself to the pepper bar. "Whaaa?", I go. They had all the great fixins to make your sandwich and fries taste the best. The cheese-steak I ordered was delivered to me in what I believe is traditional Philly-fashion, which is wrapped in paper and the server holding it with her thumb and index fingers. Whole thing, including the fries, tasted like absolute heaven. My only regret was not trying the desserts, like the shakes. Maybe in the future. Way to go, Joe's!
This spot has a nice outside set up. It can hold a good amount of people and isn't all over the sidewalk which is great. I did not eat the steaks here but I took my cousin ,she actually ordered 3 of them and she did not like them. She felt it should of had a bit more taste and toppings. Unfortunately she has to deal with it now because she bought 3 of them. It was at least a nice and neat looking sandwich unlike most cheese steaks theyvusually lool sloppy. Lol
came here on a saturday night and had a great time! service was great, cheese fries were on point and i love the pickle/pepper bar! the cheesesteak was really good but wasn't as hot as i want it to be. next time i hope it's more fresh and piping hot :)
Had I known Joe's steaks are that good I would have tried it two years ago. You can do take out or you can dine inside. If you dine inside most likely you will get a number. I didn't since such a good looking guy like me is easily remembered. You can choose half size or full size steak so you better make up your mind before you come inside. Also have an idea how you want your cheesesteak made (type of cheese, toppings etc) salt, pepper, mayo and condiments are all located in the back so you don't have to ask for those. What is special about those cheesesteaks? I don't know maybe it's the fact that chunks of meat are nice and big and juicy, maybe it's the fried onion and melted cheese but its darn good. I will be back. Probably my cheesesteak venue of choice from now on. Enjoy
I was in philly for business and was on a cheesesteak kick.   I had heard good things about Joes and wanted to check it out.   Their large cheesesteak was on special so get the special.   HOLY CRAP was that sandwich big.   Really liked everything about it.   Also liked the pickle bar in the back.  

Service was good and liked the diner atmosphere.   I didn't wait long for the food and I never ran out of my drink.   

I would return.
Joe's has officially taken over as my favorite cheesesteak, most of the time. The portions are generous but not overwhelming, but the prices reflect that, and if you really need to gorge, order two for the same price you'll pay for one at most places. I haven't had a bad steak here. Lower than most on grease, higher on flavor and always fresh rolls. They've been accommodating with my fiancé's ever-changing topping requests. Mine are basic. Cheesesteak, with wiz, without... can't get much simpler. Also can't get much better when you're craving something to fill your stomach after a few drinks at midnight.
My friend and I were visiting Philly, and wanted to try a cheesesteak.. problem? She's highly allergic to gluten, and trying to find a gluten free.. not an easy task. We googled, and this place popped up, and I'm SO glad we decided to pick this place. DELICIOUS, and cheap??? Perfect!
There's an open pickle bar. Pickles and banana peppers are amazing. 
I ordered a cheesesteak with extra cheese whiz, the buffalo chicken fries, and the shake of the month. 
Everything was drool worthy, and she even said her roll was too! (The roll was only $2 extra, tbh that's a steal)
The employees are super sweet, it's a fun atmosphere, and next time I'm in Philly, I'm coming again!
Full Disclosure! I went on a mini cheese steak tour into the city with my friends, and we went to eight total places. My review will reflect my opinion of only a basic cheese steak with choice of cheese, and in comparison to each other. I'll additionally disclose when I went to each place, to consider how full we already were.

Stop 8 of 8: We arrived here and got to sit down and be served, that was a nice touch. The venue was clean and had a 70's diner vibe (at least what I saw in movies,) and the staff was friendly. 

We ordered the small cheese steak with American cheese with a little bit of wiz, per the waitress' recommendation. the bread is consistent and the overall steak had a good balance, except the wiz is just too overpowering. The caramelized onions are nice too. The meat was flavorful and well prepared. On it's own, its incredibly delicious! However, compared to some of the other places in the city, it wasn't great.
Pleasantly surprised and got a filling, no-nonsense sandwich. Came by Friday night just looking for some late night grub with some friends and were seated right away. Place looked busy and looked like a lot of people ordered food to go. Got the honey mustard chicken sandwich and french fries. It came with a cup of flavorful melted cheese. There was a sort of sliced pickle bar that complemented the meal at the back, I enjoyed the pickles for sure. The inside was like an old school diner. Cool, unique vibe. Nothing fancy, but fun and filling.
Joe's makes a great cheesesteak! Their steak is cut in strips, not chopped so keep that in mind. I'm a huge fan of the strip cut steak but I know some people aren't. Get wiz wit! Onions are tasty, wiz is perfect. Fresh rolls. Very cool retro feel inside and steaks are made quickly. If there was any parking nearby I would probably stop every time I drove by.
I second Fox's opinion on the ratings here. I'm not sure if the hipsters that live around here don't think it's "meta" enough for them or something but they are way off. 

This is without a doubt one of the top three cheesesteak places in the city. The one on Torresdale probably is slightly better, but this is hands down the best place to get a cheesesteak around this part of town.
You would not think it (certainly not me), but this hole in the wall joint in Fishtown makes one heckuva good cheesesteak (and milkshake). The price and quality of the product is unbelievable and unbeatable.

The interior reminds me of a West Coast surf-shop, with the sandwiches served on paper and the super relaxed atmosphere from the customers. 

The location is perfect too, as it is only half a block away from the Girard subway station on the Market-Frankford line. That is what I call saving money!

When I tasted the milkshake with the cheesesteak, it was the perfect blend. Nothing left out and nothing to feel sorry for. It was like two sinners meant for each other. Let them have it. It just makes for an incredibly dangerous and sinful combo waiting to burst.

If I had to nitpick on the restaurant, I will on two things. The wait staff was pretty curt when I asked them questions, and the pickles at the pickle bar were just a bit too tart. I thought this would reflect their take on the meat, but I was wrong. Go easy on the brine fellas!

All that being said, the size of the milkshake is well above average. I think anybody there would gain 1-2 pounds just ordering here. Thank goodness I did not get fries! But I think now I have said... too much. Go try it out!
Great cheesesteak in Fishtown. Meat is good, cheese is good, and bread is great. Nice and soft yet strong enough to hold everything together. I'm a big fan of their pickle and pepper station.

The fries were okay. I got take out and they probably would've been better at the store so that's not their fault. I paid extra dollar for some whiz on the side and have zero regrets.

Overall, this stuff is great drunk or sober. No need to hit the madness at Pat's or Geno's to get the best cheesesteak.
A nice bright cheery and serviceable diner stop for food pre-show or late night post-show (on weekend nights) after visiting Johnny Brenda's or Kung Fu Necktie.  While this isn't my absolute top favorite Philly cheesesteak, it's decent enough to make my top 5 and they don't skimp on the meat or whiz.  It also comes in a "small" size which basically means "a good size for a normal person who isn't a lumberjack".  Be prepared for it to leak on your shirt.  I looked like I'd been in a duel with squeeze bottles of whiz at ten paces after trying to eat half in the car. The fries here are crinkle cut, which at other places would mean they came from a frozen bag and taste accordingly yuck, but here they seem fresh and were cooked to crispy, which to me made up for them not being my preferred shoestrings.  The price point is great (especially compared with the more touristy cheesesteak restaurants) and they take credit cards so no hassling around looking to get robbed at some ATM with a huge fee. 

The staff are also reasonably organized and impressively polite given what they likely have to deal with late at night in a bar area.  I'd suggest having a "takeout orders" counter with a big sign so the counter lady wouldn't have to ask every drunk stumbling in whether they wanted eat-in or  take-out, but then again drunks aren't good at reading signs so she'd likely have to ask most of them anyway. 

Overall a solid joint and I will be in again. The milkshakes here look good too, but I haven't had one yet because a big ice cream shake combined with beers in my stomach doesn't seem like a good plan especially at midnight, so I'll have to make it down during the day sometime.
We come here every time we visit Philadelphia! The best cheesesteaks in town!! You can either walk up to the takeout window and be seated inside their small diner. Service is fast and attentive. Menu has a good selection of sandwiches/burgers, home made sodas, and of course cheesesteaks. You can add a variety of toppings which is always the best route to a slammin sammy. They have pickles (used to have a pickle bar pre-covid) that are absolutely decadent , I mean as far as a pickle can go! Cool thing about this place is that you can get gluten free bread or a vegan cheesesteak. Great for groups that have food preferences or allergies. Definitely check Joe's out if your a first timer in the area and are looking for an authentic Philly cheesesteaks.
Can't really complain about Joe's! This is a solid place for a cheesesteak and if you're in a pinch you can order from their walk-up window for takeout.

A group of friends and I were initially supposed to go to a neighboring restaurant, but they couldn't accommodate our party's size. As a last resort, we ended up grabbing cheesesteaks from Joe's and I'm so glad we did. While there were hella people lined up and waiting for their orders, the service was reasonably quick. The meat for their cheesesteaks are chopped up and the cheese whiz was well-incorporated into the sandwich, which I appreciated.

Would come back!

Happy eating and stay safe, yall!
I normally visit this location on weekends with family and friends and take my food to go. The weekend staff are always very friendly and my food is always well prepared. I order a large steak with wiz fries and a root beer float every time I visit and I've never had an issue with the service or food BUT this time I visited on a Monday and it was a completely different atmosphere. Me and my sister weren't greeted, staff wasn't as hospitable as usual, my steak was EXTREMELY DRY!!! My steak wasn't even cut in half there was barely any wiz on the whole sandwich when I say it was like eating cardboard I'm not exaggerating. This was my sisters first time in philly and she wanted an authentic cheesesteak so I took her to Joes bc my previous experiences were always so good but I will never return to this location nor recommend it to any of my friends or family again. My whole meal came to $24, I can spend $5 at the local bodega and receive better treatment and wayyyy better food than Joes. Very disappointing to drive out my way and receive such underwhelming food. Never again
This is in my top 5 cheesesteak shops in Philly. The dine in area is nice and gives me old school diner vibes. All the condiments, pickles, and sweet peppers are found to the side and it is always stocked.

I usually go with wiz wit and mushrooms. The cheesesteak is meaty and seasoned well. The wiz they serve has good consistency and flavor. The milkshakes were just ok. Definitely a go-to spot if you're in the area drinking and chilling with friends, or just want a good sandwich.
I had a girls acrylic nail in my cheesesteak it almost broke my tooth ! I took it back an they ask if I wanted another steak  not cool at all!!   Anyway I just left without refund nor with another steak .
8:19 ordered... 8:46 finally got out order FOR TAKE OUT! Ppl behind us were getting their orders before us. It wasn't even crowded and workers were just standing around. Never again.
Meat had great flavor & bread was hearty. Shakes were also delicious.

I loved the diner feel. You could order outside at the to go window or have a seat inside and be served.
No need to sugarcoat this. My friends and I went here last night absolutely trashed. 2 cheesesteaks and 2 chicken cheesesteaks were ordered around 2 am. It was fast, hot, and pretty good. I thought 10 bucks was a little excessive though. I'll try them sober to see if my opinion stays true.
This place was great! Delicious steaks, nice seating and friendly server. My fiancé got a milk shake as well and said it was really good. We tried both the chicken and the steak, equally as good, and for a large it's pretty reasonably priced compared to the other steak shops
Decent cheesesteaks and milkshakes, but it's expensive -- about as expensive as Wahlburgers. They have a limited cheesesteak menu -- without pizza steaks or long hot peppers. Their shake menu is pretty standard. For those that said this is a tourist dive, it is. I recommend tourists visit here to get a taste of the Fishtown vibe and grab a cheesesteak. However, there are far better places in Philadelphia for cheesesteaks.
First time grabbing a bite from Joe's and was very excited walking in the retro diner style eatery. The signs that read, Hand-cut fires, milkshakes, etc. were  designed in such a way that it reminded me of the Jetsons cartoon. Very cool. 

You are also immediately hit with the lovely sent of cheesesteaks being pepared; around noon there is already people stuffing their faces while talking at the same time. Amusing and fun to me but, also a good sign that the food is pretty good. 

I decided to take-out rather than eat in. I ordered a Mint chocolate chip milkshake and a small cheesesteak with onions. The milkshake was awesome, the right thickness and smooth. The cheesesteak was also pretty good and flavorful but, do wish the onions (which had a sweet taste) were cooked more. I did add a little of cajun seasoning from home. Gives it a spicy edge. Eating in you have a variety of sauces and a pickle bar available to you. Either way, thumbs up!
I know everyone says this about their cheesesteak spot, but Joe's is the actual best. I tried it for the first time today out of convenience and I'm entirely sold.
Philly doesn't mess around when it comes to steaks. Although I've always been a fan of some of the other guys in town including John, Steve, and Tony Luke, Joe has really made a name for himself. Back in the day, when Joe went by another name (props to those who know who I'm talking about), I used to pay his Northeast location a visit from time to time. I loved the cheeseteaks, fries and the service; however, wasn't the biggest fan of the neighborhood. 

Thankfully, Philly now has a new Joe's location right in Fishtown. You can now enjoy one of the best steaks in the city of brotherly love and be just a few steps from the Fillmore, Johnny Brenda's, Frankford Hall, Barcade and a slew of other hip spots. I find myself in this neighborhood more frequently these days and my senses tell me that won't be stopping anytime soon...
Best cheesesteak I've had in Philly so far, although I haven't been to Jim's yet. Get it with both provolone and wiz and it won't disappoint. Love the pickle and pepper bar.
By far my favorite Philly cheesesteak. I feel like not a whole lot of people are familiar with Joe's when I ask around, so clearly they're missing out. The original name of the place was Chinks and the original location is on Torresdale Ave. I was ecstatic when I heard this location in Fishtown opened up because it gave me the indication that business is booming. Genos, Pats, and Jim's do not come anywhere close to the greatness of Joe's steaks. I started coming here about 2 years ago or so, with special thanks to my uncle on an awesome recommendation. This will forever be my go to for cheesesteaks!
The one on Torresdale is our staple for cheesesteaks. The new one is just as good has amazing food and staff. The same custom milkshakes that change every month ( see my pic of the candy corn one) the best part is this one is open late night so I can stop in anytime. They cook in  the window and hand make the shakes. Try the buffalo chicken French fries. Hot and crispy with huge chunks of chicken on them. . Also that Stirling who works at this location. She is just amazing
