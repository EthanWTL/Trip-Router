I have been to this museum both times I visited Philly because the information is so rich and I wanted to make sure everyone who is with me gets to learn. This museum is the real deal with actually artifacts from the time of slavery and the history you learn will always stick with you. I wish we were taught this history in schools but unfortunately we are not. The two owners are so friendly and give an excellent presentation/tour. I recommend all to visit this museum. It is truly a great experience.
This museum is like a precious diamond because it holds the most sacred parts of our ancestors' history in America. The artifacts are genuine pieces that remind us of such a horrible history of slavery, and also to remind us of the damage that was passed down from generation to generation. There is no doubt that many of us still hold the pains, trauma, and suffering within our DNA after 400 years of servitude. We were there on 1/3/2020, and I felt blessed to be in the presence of such a well educated and spoken narrator. I love the location, the building gave me the impression and feeling of walking into an underground secret society that holds the key to our past, present, and future journey. Thank you, Gwen Ragsdale(curator).
