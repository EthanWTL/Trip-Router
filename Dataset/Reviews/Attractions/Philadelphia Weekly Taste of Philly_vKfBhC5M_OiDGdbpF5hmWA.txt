In what was once the world's largest restaurant - the Crystal Tea Room of John Wanamaker's - the foods and drinks of Philadelphia were celebrated in the annual party called  'A Taste of Philly.'  There are certainly a lot of foods to try here as well as drinks.  I felt so full afterwards that I never want to see another item of food again in my life.  There's something for everyone.  My favorite food was the escargots from Crow and the Pitcher.  And my favorite drink was alcoholic sparkling water - a new concept for me.  It all ended nicely with an Insomnia cookie and a key lime pie from Morton's. There was live music throughout but no one danced.  I think we all ate too much!  The setting is classic old world charm from the atrium to the vast main dining room to the cozy pub to the Viennese wood-paneled side room.  Make sure you get tickets for "'A Taste of Philly' next year and attend on an empty stomach!
I heard so many positive things about Taste of Philly from friends whom attended this event prior to 2015. For the price, including the discount code I received from a friend, I couldn't pass up the opportunity  to sample the food and beverages from establishments throughout Philadelphia. 

All the issues stemmed from one key element missing from this event; organization. I didn't experience any of the issues upon checking in. I arrived, a gentleman in the lobby scanned my codes off my phone, and that was that. It was a different world once I got upstairs. 

If there was a pamphlet or a map to assist the attendees navigate the room I missed it, and I apologize in advance for this review. It was difficult trying to figure out who the vendors were. Some tables has signs stating who they were but for the  most part, you didn't see them unless you went right up to the table. In addition you didn't know what they were offering. You really didn't know any of this until it was your turn after waiting in line for a long time; hoping you were in the right line. This event attracted too many people again leading to the lack of organization to the flow of traffic on the floor.

By 8:00pm most of the vendors were out of food. I think I sampled food from four vendors, and nothing note worthy to make me want to attend the next event. Had it not been for the loaves of Italian bread I took home, I probably would have had less food at this event.

At the end of the day, it was a waste of time, and a waste of money.
This event SUCKS!  Long lines.  Not enough food.  Been twice hoping second time would be better.  It still SUCKS!  Stay away from this ripoff!


Just returned from Taste of Philly 2017 at World Cafe Live!  Once again, this event sucks... no matter where they have it!  Thimble size beer samples.  Pre-made cold tacos in aluminum foil and some Middle Eastern stuff.  Cold, dry chicken kabobs.  And the real insult is absolutely NO seating.  You'd better be a good juggler!  This event still .... SUCKS!
I recently attended two Philadelphia events  1) The Philadelphia Film Festival and  2) A Taste Of Philly..On both occasions I encountered that dreaded disease that is infecting Center City: Hipster Rude.You'll know it when you see it. People of a certain age who think their shit is ice cream and everyone should be running for a spoon. The film festival this year for the most part was decent .I have nothing but praise for the volunteers. BUT the people who ran the event need customer sensitivity training and manners.You know who you are.Please learn to acknowledge those who may want to write a check to finance your new project on Samson street.2) Taste of   Philly  not as many vendors this year. as last year. I suspect because the current economy. That I can understand. Again rude guests who could not wait in line to get their fill for $25.00. This is first  time in three years  I've  encountered annoyed vendors,and rude servers.Next year I'll write a check for 25.00 to the charity and stay home.
Taste of Philly can be one of the greatest sampling events in Philly....when done correctly. The past few years have been killer good, and I've definitely been known to talk up this event. Unfortunately, 2014's event fell short and I had to eat my words. 

-It was too crowded. Understandably an event like this is going to draw a crowd, especially at this price point. I felt like I was spending my day at an amusement park...waiting on long lines for a few moments of enjoyment. Unlike an amusement park, you didn't know where the lines for each table started and it made it a little confusing to get in the appropriate line. Once you get the lay of the land, waiting time got turned into eating/drinking time. At least you can bring something with you on the line. 

-There were less food and drink vendors than there had been in the past. With the size of the crowd, the more the better in terms of number of vendors. Especially since there was extra space around the venue. 

-Food ran out really quickly due to the size of the event and number of folks attending. It's unfortunate but I guess food at the "popular" tables will go first and fast. 

-This year's vendor selection just wasn't too hot. Yes, there were some great vendors there, and I will never turn down a drumstick from heaven from Indieblue, but I felt the caliber of vendors in the "Indieblue category" weren't as abundant this year.  

-I was expecting more local food. While I absolutely loved Ben and Jerry's pumpkin cheesecake ice cream, I was hoping there'd be more native Philly flavors there. Same with Chickie & Pete's. I've had so many crab fries in my life, I had no desire to use my tummy space and calories there. It was nice to see some newcomers to the scene represented. Sushi from Hai Street and Sourcream Panacatta from the Treemont? Yes, please! 

-It was awesome that some of the breweries were handing out full bottles and cans....until they had to close up shop so early in the evening. Pouring samples into smaller cups, really could have gone a long way in extending the evening. Quality of beverages was definitely there though- DuClaw, SlyFox and 2nd Story Brewing to name a few!
Side note: the 2013 set-up with the beer in the center of the room was my favorite set up they've done. It was convenient to stop for a drink and it seemed like a great use of the space. I hope they'd go back to it!

-I didn't love the band and they were pretty loud. For an event like this a DJ could do wonders. I know a band should be able to read the crowd, but a DJ would really be able to control the tunes and sound. 


One off year isn't going to sway me from going back, but I'm hoping they recognize the shortcomings from the 2014 event and step up their game next year. I feel I got my money's worth, and did get to sample some really good things. I just know they can (and have) done better.
First time at Taste of Philly this past week. It was a fun experience overall.

Pros:
-beautiful location at the Crystal tearoom
-lines moved relatively quick, despite length
-lots of beers and great drinks
-DJ was great, mixed current and throwback songs. definitely catered to the local crowd and had a lot of people dancing!
-great value, for $35 general admission, it's a good deal. plus some proceeds go to Philabundance, an organization I have volunteered throughout my youth!

Cons:
-very confusing to figure out how to enter the crystal tea room. where the heck is the entrance?
-lines for vendors were disorganized; it was hard to figure out which line led to which vendor
-food ran out by 7:30...really??
-a lot of the same kinds of cuisines/food..I had about 3 fish tacos, 2 escargot, 3-4 brisket or pulled pork sandwiches.

If they can organize this better, provide more variety and/or unique vendors, I'd be sold!
