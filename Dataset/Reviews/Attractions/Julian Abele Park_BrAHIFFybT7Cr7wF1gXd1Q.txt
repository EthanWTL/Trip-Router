Okay, I understand the no dogs thing because they want it to be free off dog poop for kids to play. But HEY it's the only grass in the area, and occasionally a dog poops somewhere you don't exactly want them to. A GREAT way to avoid having this park be a mess is adding a trash can! I know the park originally wanted a the solar trash cans, but seriously if it's going to take that long for one of them (when they're really not even that great) let's just settle for the classic kind and keep the park cleaner with it.
Good local park. WOuld love fencing for the dogs. Good spot to meet your neighbors.
Terrific. Needs more work, but I know it's coming. Thank you Sosna for giving us this park. Convenient and safe place to walk my princess Fiona.
