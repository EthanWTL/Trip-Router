The Constitutional Walking tour is well worth the money especially if you have out-of-town visitors. Our tour guide Debbie was excellent. She walked us around to 22 different historic sites and gave a brief history of each one. For a small girl her voice was loud enough to carry over the traffic and street noise. You do not go inside any buildings but, the tour will help you select which sites you'd like to explore further on your own.
We needed to re-book our time slot, so I called and it's $5 per person to re-book, which is stated plainly in their initial confirmation email. But even though it's more than two months to our tour date, they wouldn't even consider reducing the fee.  It's $5 for each person in our group of seven. Even the four-year-old pays.  The tour fee is also not refundable.

It's too bad...not a way to run a business. At least let us re-book if the fees are not refundable. I hope the tour experience is worthwhile, but I'm almost ready to look for another option, and let them keep the fees, rather than have a disappointing experience with our limited time there.
Had Melissa as a tour guide for a private 90 min walking tour for a group of 25.  It was very windy and cold but the guide wa very informative, professional, personable and knowledgeable.  Melissa interacted with everyone and was a wealth of knowledge showing her passion for history.  She accommodated our wishes of spending more or less time on certain attractions. Definately worth the time and money!!! Will use this tour group again if I'm back touring Philly. Highly recommended!
