This was my first time at the kick-off party.  My only riff was the size of the venue.  It was just so crowded that we couldn't see everything.  I'm a science geek so i wanted to check out each and every single exhibit.  I also was not aware there was food upstairs.  By the time we got up there all the food was gone. Crowd control could have probably been controlled if ticket sales were capped.  Lastly, i even missed the yelp table :(.
While I didn't spend too much time at the Philadelphia Science Festival carnival, I could tell that it was a pretty cool family friendly event. Had I not been heading to the other two festivals in town on the same day, I certainly would spent more time. That's right. It's family friendly and still cool for adults. 

It was pretty crowded and you had to do your fair share of dodging big and small bodies. But that could only be expected at a popular city festival. 

I'm not sure if it's usually the same day as the other festivals, but this a good one to keep in mind for children and children at heart.
