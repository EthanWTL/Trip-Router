Drexel Park offers sweeping views of Philadelphia from an easily accessible West Philadelphia location. There is a bunch of parking on Barring Street which is free for two hours. The park is pretty small but I have visited it many times. I actually have very fond memories of Drexel Park from when I was a Drexel student. Laying out a blanket to study and watch the dogs. The grass itself is a little spotty so I wish it was better maintained. 

You'll see students out playing frisbee and tanning. There aren't food trucks parked here but you are a short walk from California Pizza and Pdubs where you can pick up some food and walk over. It's a great place for a chill date or an easy study spot. . 

I've also used this location as a backdrop for photos. After graduation from Drexel, I came here to mark the occasion. I also know Modern Baseball - a local pop punk band - has used this same park as a backdrop for a photoshoot.
I have never truly explored Philly before but this view looks promising 
Luckily we had the pleasure of going to Drexel Park which was just down the block to the bed and breakfast we were staying at
