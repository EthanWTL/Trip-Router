It's small (so far), but the message is big and for the concept alone, 4 stars. Percy Street Project is the latest street art installation in the city. Located on the 1300 block of Percy, on your left just before Pat's and Geno's is "Electric Street" which was created to deter the major crime (prostitution, drug dealing, underage drinking and "short dumping" which is termed unique to Philadelphia aka illegal trash disposal) which took place often in this alleyway. That is, until these lights were turned on! How amazing?! What a fantastic, colorful and creative way to tackle crime! 

Great for photo ops, both during the day and at night. Don't expect too much as it's only one or two garage spaces wide, but I think they really have something going on here!! I'm excited to see what it can lead to!
An Instagram worthy quick place to check out if you're in the Passyunk, Termini's Bakery, Pats/Genos area. A neon sign art installation on the side of a building, located down a deteriorated alleyway. Go after dark for the full effect, and get your camera ready to snap away!

Park nearby on Passyunk, Reed or 9th streets and then walk down Percy Street. You only really need 5 or 10 minutes here, so swing by next time you're in the area!
Stumbled across this location on social media and I was really excited to check it out. It's in walking distance of Pat and Geno's Steaks so if you're ever hungry and want an adventure, this is a great place to find. There are many great places for artistic inspiration and this is definitely one of them.
Artists use this alleyway for photo shoots, and videos. Random people also use this spot for the same thing lol. Anyway I think it's the perfect background shot for whatever. Come by and take a picture but keep it moving nothing much to see here.
