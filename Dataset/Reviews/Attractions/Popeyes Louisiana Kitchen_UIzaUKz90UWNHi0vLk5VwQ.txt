I drove 4 miles just to find out they don't sell chicken tenders after 10:00. What kind of service is that? The crazy part about it the manager told me that! By the way they are open until 11:00! #popeyes sucks! I
Finally got around to trying Popeyes chicken sandwich last night and placed an order through Uber eats.  I'm not sure if it was due to the lack of attention from the app or if this is standard, but the drinks were wrong and I ordered 6 chocolate beignets and instead got apple pies.  Apple pie isn't really my thing, but my boyfriend loved them, still not what I ordered though.  The chicken sandwich was juicy but couldn't used more flavor, not sure I understand the hype as Chick-fil-A has better flavor, but still tasty enough to go back.  The Cajun fries my boyfriend got were very good, I enjoyed the rice and beans, and I tried a taste of the biscuit but they were basically hockey pucks so that was disappointing.  I assume it depends when you get to the biscuits and maybe you can get lucky earlier in the day on that one.   Despite the lackluster order I would actually return, but this particular location probably needs to train up their staff a bit more to pay attention to details and not throw in food that has been dying under a heat lamp for hours.
