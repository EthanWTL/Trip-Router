A unique, well-curated experience with a true expert on the subject matter and the city. We got to see the schools where great Philly artists got their start, where some lived, and got an appreciation for the stories behind buildings, some that you would recognize and others you would never notice if it weren't for the expert narration along the tour! Come with your questions on Philly music history and you'll get them answered. We learned many surprising and fun facts about famous musicians on this tour. An enjoyable way to spend half a day and get to see different parts of the city!
