Took our 11 year old niece on the Independence Tour and were thrilled with the experience! David was extremely knowledgeable, and helped bring the stories of the revolution to life in a way that made you  feel as if the founding fathers were real people instead of just names you memorized in history class. Very informative and interesting and highly recommended for anyone looking to get more insight into the history of our nation!
We loved our tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable and made the tour very interesting. He was great at personalizing it a bit when we told him some of the things we were interested in. We are native Philadelphians and definitely had walked by several of the interesting spots on the tour previously without knowing what we were missing. We would definitely join for another one of the tours offered by Bow Tie Tours in the future.
Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and had great stories to tell about the historic part of Philly. You should definitely check them out if you want a more personalized tour of the sites!
Was expecting a tour of the historical city... got a lecture on Adams and Jefferson. It was slow - and disappointing. We had to ask questions to get the guide back on track. Finally gave the tour guide a tip just to stop the pain and went and explored on our own. Such a waste of time and money. As a travel agent I will not recommend this company.
We had a wonderful experience learned so much from David. His knowledge of the City (and history in general) was impressive. Thanks again!
I booked the Philly Bowtie Independence Tour Extraordinaire yesterday, and it was fantastic. 

PROS:
-The tour is a great survey of Revolutionary War history, I'm guessing whether you're steeped in this stuff or a relative novice (like me).
-Not only did David answer questions fully, he added extra details and fun facts. (Like describing Washington's rise to commander of the Continental Army and then president, complemented by an anecdote of Washington "throwing the bar" at Mount Vernon. I had no idea our first president was such a stud.) David clearly digs his work. 
-He was also patient throughout, despite my asking questions on things that I probably should have remembered from high school. 
-He books your entry to Independence Hall, 2nd National Bank and other sites in advance, so you don't have to stand in line.  

CONS:
-None. Book this tour, you will absolutely love it.
