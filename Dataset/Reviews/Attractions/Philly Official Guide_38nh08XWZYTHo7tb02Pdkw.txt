Chris is a great guide.  Energetic, informative and interesting.  We had a great time taking his walking tour.  Thank you!
Chris was beyond amazing! If this is your first time to the city of Philadelphia, a frequent visitor, or a local, this tour is for you. This was my first time in Philly, my husband's fourth trip, and my son and his girlfriend live here. We all had a fantastic time and we were blown away with Chris's knowledge and his enthusiasm to share it with us. He took us to all the highlights of Philly then went beyond with information you would not get on any of those other tours, into neighborhoods we would never have seen. He made the tour feel personalized just to us and he made sure he covered anything Philly that we would like to see or learn about, and all of this on The 4th of July! I would highly recommend calling "Colonial Chris" the Philly Official Guide if you are looking for a tour.
