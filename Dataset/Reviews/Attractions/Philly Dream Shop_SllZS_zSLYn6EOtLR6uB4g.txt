This place is at 254 s. street not 2054! I went to the wrong location.. It's right on the corner of 3rd and South street

Friendly staff, I asked a ton of questions and the young guy (sales assistant) helped me with no problem or frustration..and I KNOW I was a pest lol
Bought a Pax vaporizer from here and it was a counterfeit fake one
Philly, my dreams have been answered.

They have the beer bongs. 

Les bongs temps rouler.
Today I saw a bong that looks like the Eiffel Tower and a bong built in to a gas mask. Who knew?
Went to this shop and was impressed. Guy working was friendly and even threw in some freebies. Will definitely be going back soon.
I tried this store recently.  They have a great selection of hookah tobacco.  They have a Jordanian brand called Fursan, which is the best ever.  The staff is great and very helpful.  Their service and selection is far better than JS Cigars which s nearly across the street.  I used to go to JS Cigars, but now that Dream Shop is open I now have the right store.  All hookah smokers should know that the Dream Shop has Fresh Tobacco!  Not dry stale tobacco like JS Cigars.  Thank you, Philly Dream Shop
Waaaaaaaaw. Guys if you smoke hookah you have to try a new brand that is new its called ALRAYAN TOBACCO OMG its heaven smooth, delicious and amazing. I love the flavors that they have. its almost like your smoking real fruits. Its a must to try. its better thank Alfaker and starbuzz. I am hooked.
Friendly staff and deals all the time (all glass pieces 30% off, etc). It can be a bit hard to browse sometimes,though, when it gets crowded.
Hands down the best little store for tobacco needs in all of Philly! I used to smoke hookah and this place had the best flavors and pricing I'd ever seen! Much better than any others on South St. Thanks guys!
