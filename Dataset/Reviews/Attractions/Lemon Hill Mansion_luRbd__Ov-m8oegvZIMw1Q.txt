Lemon HIll is a perfect place to go when you get sick of Kelly Drive, and don't have the heart to go for a long extended run.

It's a stone's throw from Fairmount and Art Museum, and if you are in the mood to just hang out with your sweetheart, it's a great place for walking and relaxing.  Much quieter and secluded from the bustle of Kelly Dr.

If you get a chance, run up Lemon Hill, then keep going - if you can mapquest your course, there is a nice loop that will eventually take you back on the path to Kelly Dr., and all in all it's a nice little 5+ mile loop.  Philly Runner posts a nice article about it: http://www.philadelphiarunner.com/traininphilly.html

Also, there is something called the Lemon Hill loop which I can't wait to ride!  http://www.bikely.com/maps/bike-path/Loop-through-lower-Fairmount-Park
I live nearby and wandered in one day.  It's a beautiful house full of beautiful things and lots of Philadelphia history.  There are great views of the city and the Schuylkill.  I thoroughly enjoyed spending the afternoon checking the place out, chatting with the knowledgeable person working there, and taking pictures of the place.  If you're into history, Philadelphia history, architecture, or antiques it is well worth a visit!
When I was in college, I took a class on Fairmount Park (yay, liberal arts)... and ended up here.

This is a scenic, beautiful revolutionary mansion that has amazing artifacts, and sits on the oldest, old money hill in Philly. It's amazing, if you get a tour guide, what they can tell you about the city back then. It's not a high-octane site... but for slower paced history, art, and civic lovers, this is an oft overlooked place to spend a sunny afternoon.
