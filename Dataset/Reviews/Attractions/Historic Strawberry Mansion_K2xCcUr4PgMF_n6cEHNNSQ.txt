This was a wonderful day in the sun for The Strawberry Festival here at The Strawberry Mansion House in beautiful Fairmount Park.  There was so much to do and see. We were entertained by the lovely Vessna Scheff. She sang originals and pop favorites with her beautifully unique flair. Check her out here https://www.vessnascheff.com/. The children played with the Kids yes they had young goats to pet. LOL...A creative artist offered free face painting for the children and they loved it. There were a lot of donated treats made of strawberries and strawberry combinations. Most of all there were lots of free strawberries to eat there or take home with you. There are a lot of things to see here in this part of the park. The grounds are lovely and the flowers are beautiful, the Mansion is magnificent!

During the festival there was a free tour of The Strawberry Mansion House. The narration of history was very interesting and delivered with a colorful flair by the wonderful Ty. He spoke of so many Philadelphia 1st's, truly fascinating. 

I hope this festival continues to grow as I will make sure to be time next year.
If I could give this place no stars, I would. I went to a wedding here, and the location is nice, but the staff was nasty and beyond unhelpful. The bride needed to use the restroom, and the staff would not let her in. They acted like White House security was necessary to protect it from a 60 person wedding for a tour of the house.
This was the summer villa for Judge Lewis back in the 19th century.

It's beautifully furnished inside and renovated. The furniture is of the period, but not original to the house.

The guide, Ty, was very knowledgeable, and dressed in Beau Brummel style clothing.

For awhile, this place was used as a restaurant, and lots of famous people ate here.
