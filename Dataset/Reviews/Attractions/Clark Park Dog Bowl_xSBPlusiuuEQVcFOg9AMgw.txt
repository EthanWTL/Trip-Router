I DO!, I DO!

Oh, the Clark Park Dog Bowl.... a giant football field sized pit in the middle of Clark Park that serves as the community's unofficial dog-run.  

Note, that there is a "real" dog-run up the street from Clark Park on about 48th and Chester, but they (i have no idea who)  want you to pay to become a member, which in my opinion (and by opinion I mean self evident truth) is bullshit.  Pay to have your dog run around like a lunatic? no, no, no.... I believe ill exercise that right for free.  

The Clark Park Dog Bowl is a great place to let your dog play around and get some good unleashed exercise, meet all the dogs you've seen walkin' in the neighborhood but never had the courage to pet, and possibly make some new friends.

Before bringing the mutt down to the Bowl, there are some things i'm gonna run by you so you can judge if your pup can handle itself.... firstly, there's no fences. Your dog can run away, and if your a shitty owner, it will run away, so be warned. You have no idea who these other dogs are, and since the place isn't city sponsored, if your dog gets eaten by a bigger one, there's no-one to cry to but the other owner. And lastly, there's a children's playground right above the Bowl, so if your dog's givin' off  ' the dingo ate my baby ' vibe while hes eyein' down that two year old on the swings... I suggest to re-leash him and get him out of there...   

So, if you think your dog can pass the test, bringum' down, there's always a few pups there waiting for more company..
I love it. There's not many people during the day which is great for my pup to run around the entire length of the bowl. I love all the other friendly owners, dog friends Franko gets to make. It's a lovely park -- water fountain for the dogs, plenty of running room. Great place to take your dog. most owners let their dogs run around with no leash :)
I don't own a dog (Yet!). But this is my true side of Clark Park and I love every moment of it. I truly feel that there's good reasons why if you search "Clark Park" on Yelp, you're going to see at least four separate reviews come up. and that's because there's so much going on inside it that it's hard to keep track of. 

Overall I think Emily and Chrissy summed it up best on it's look. Clark Park doesn't offer up that much appearance wise. But when it comes to the people and events inside it Clark Park can be pretty damn incredible! It's pretty much the equivalent of David Lee Roth. And I Might As Well JUMP....

On to the next paragraph! True the main part of Clark Park on Baltimore has it's Flea Market's, Farmer's Market's, sword fighting kids, music festivals, drum circles, volley ball courts, and turtle. But the Dog Bowl pretty much has all of that (minus the Farmer's Market and Turtle), a playground, basketball courts, Shakespeare in the park, fire dancers, random BBQs, water ice, movie nights, double the music fests (I love me some Best Fest!), and smores cookouts in the Fall. And the fact that they're both a block away from one another makes Clark Park one big happy family.
hooray for the great outdoors!
pretty sweet space. one downside is after rain it gets pretty darn soggy in that dog bowl. plenty of street parking around.
Just a heads up-- this isn't a dog park. It's a park with a deep valley (shaped like a bowl) where dogs can go off leash. But it's not fenced-- personally, my pooch would take off running. But it was a pretty park and the other dog owners were very friendly!
I've hula hooped here, drank red-flavored Boone's Farm here, read a book here, done cartwheels here, had a picnic here, drank coffee here, taken pictures here, laid in the grass here, rode my bike through here, but ironically, have never taken a dog here.

That's because I don't own one.
Things I have done in the dog bowl:
-Watched pick-up soccer games.
-Read a book.
-Drunkenly rolled down the hill at midnight.
-Listened to a drum circle while watching people juggle fire.
-Caught other people's frisbees.
-Watched Best Fest.
-Watched neighborhood legend Omar dance at Best Fest.
-Had a beer. Had two. How about that bottle of champagne?
-Watched an entire neighborhood come out to survey post-storm damage and bond over the experience.
-Eaten my Fuh-Wah tofu hoagie.
-Eaten my cupcake from the Cupcake Lady.
-Made friends with other people's dogs and children.

Yeah, I totally agree that some folks are so irresponsible they should be banned from having dogs and/or children and they occasionally make the dog bowl a little frustrating. And it's far from the prettiest part of the park. But this is such a great space I'm not about to complain.
everytime i've come here, there's been a few people running around with their pups. my little guy doesn't do well with other dogs so i always have him on a leash. he still enjoys coming here to walk and hang out...the bowl is huge! i'm watching my friend's dog for two weeks. he's the opposite of my dog. he's large, super friendly and very energetic. he loved it here. it was about to rain so the ground was pretty muddy but the pups really enjoyed it and were pooped out when we got back home. i always love having a great park near where i live.
