Awesome! I used Sky River last Saturday night to get engaged and I can assure you, it wasn't a mistake. The pilot was awesome, although I cannot remember his name and I do apologize for that. We went up around 7:00 with a bottle of champagne and flew over the city. The views were awesome and the ride was smooth. We had previously discussed a little strategy of when I would propose, which I did while he was hovering around city hall at about a 1,000 feet. The pilot told me that surprisingly not of people propose this way, which really shocks me. Me and my GF have told the story many times and every time it was always "a helicopter? Really - that's AWESOME!!!". Guys, I'm telling you, don't do the played out dinner thing or the beach thing or the GOD AWFUL Jumbo-tron thing. Do yourself a favor, do it on a sunset helicopter ride, you wont regret it and I wont mind  you saying "yeah, I just thought it up" when she asks you how you came up with the idea - because I KNOW that's what you'll say. You're welcome.
I was given a "Learn to Fly" gift certificate at Sky River Helicopters. It included a pre and post flight overview and 15 minutes in the air (it actually seemed longer). I was given the controls both at altitude and hovering above the ground. Kyle was very supportive and informative. It was more difficult than expected but Kyle was there to correct any mistakes before it became dangerous. I'd recommend them to anyone.
Wow! Such an incredible experience! Would recommend for anyone looking for a romantic excursion or even someone looking for a different view of the city. Christian was an awesome pilot for our journey. My girlfriend and I were first-timers to a helicopter ride and he made our experience smooth from start to finish with his courtesy, enthusiasm, and professionalism. Remember to tip!
