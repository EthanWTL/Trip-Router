I've just visited for the first time and I can already name this my go-to place for produce. The selection is very large, fresh, and cheap! It is significantly less expensive than the other supermarkets in the area, such as Acme, ShopRite, and Giant. 

Some of the prices from my trip today include: 
$2.99 for a 2lb box of strawberries
$1.99 for a bunch of kale
$0.59/lb plantains
$0.79/lb Macintosh apples
$0.89/lb mixed color bell pepper
$1.99 for a mini seedless watermelon 
$1.59 for an aloe leaf
$0.99/lb green seedless grapes

I've included a photo of the receipt and the produce, hope it helps! I'm sold!!!

I love Green Farm, they have a great selection of produce, the one thing I really do not like about the location on Buselton, is the lack of parking and even on the street it is terrible. I never really bought anything that was bad, the produce always seems to be fresh, there have been sometimes where the produce doesn't even last a few days and that kind of upsets me, big reason why I deducted a star. There have been occurrences where parking at the Buselton location are very scarce. Other than a few things the money for produce is unmatched always some really good prices for certain items.
