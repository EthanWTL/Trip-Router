Let's just start off by saying team RUDE! I've visited this establishment a few times and everything they have been EXTREMELY RUDE, not to mention over priced,. Today they was having a full blown disagreement with a customer in front of everyone inside of the store who was waiting to get there food prepared. They also  have a nerve to have about 1000 sings up saying how they don't accept EBT or food stamps. Alright we get it. Strange things is your directly in the middle of a neighborhood where many families ((not my story but)) relay on EBT/ food stamps to make the ends meet! I'll never be back to this rude establishment. Never no where to park and you wanna be rude! No thank you I'll go else where!
Went here from a referral. Guy that was cooking food has an nasty attitude. If it was for customers spending money on your establishment there would be no business so understand that. Food was okay. Nothing to rave about. Fish is expensive. Probably won't return.
Always fresh seafood, excellent cooked seafood, reasonable prices. This is the only place I go for cooked seafood. Wish they stayed open longer than 7pm.
The food is delicious! I love their steamed platters and steamed male crabs. The best prices out here that I know of.
Garbage! Seafood is over breaded. The fish was rotten and the fries were soggy and stale. The only edible part of my meal was the corn on the cob. I should have known better because the cost was too good to be true. I'm absolutely astonished by the other 5 star reviews left for this "establishment".
Love this place! Fresh,delicious seafood cooked to perfection. I like that they open early too. My go to place for seafood and they take credit cards over $10 purchase.
Fresh fresh good seafood .On my top 5 spots ever.On my mama there the  not up for debate.
