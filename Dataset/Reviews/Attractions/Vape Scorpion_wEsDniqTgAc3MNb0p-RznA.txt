I had a day off from work and decided to visit this Vape Shop at 11:00AM...Unfortunately no one showed up even though it is posted all over the place that their hours are 11-8 Monday through Thursday. After waiting outside in my car until 11:35AM and calling the shop numerous times without an answer I decided to leave and go to my neighborhood Vape Shop where they were very open, very hospitable and very willing to sell me a new box mod and Aspire Atlantis tank and various delicious e juices.
I finally found a vape shop that I can call home :) There is an excellent selection of vapes at the store and while I was stuck on what I wanted, I was able to try a few additional flavors to add to my collection.  The owner was very patient with me and my many questions about the different types and levels of nicotine needed.
Jennifer was no help at all. Sold a broken device to me and then will not refund money.  Wish I could give less then one star
I am very disappointed today, it was my first time at "east coast vapor" also known as vape scorpion (apparently). I was greeted by a man sleeping on a couch next to the front door and proceeded to wonder around the store looking for someone able to help me. Eventually a seemingly angry man busted through the back door yelling "how can I help you". Almost unwillingly he sold me a bottle of vape juice and hastily gave me my change before informing me he was going on his lunch break and I had to leave the store. This has been by far my worst experience at a vape store and I would not recommend anyone to come here.
