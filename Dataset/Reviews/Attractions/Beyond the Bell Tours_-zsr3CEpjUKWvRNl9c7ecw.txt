When I was searching tour options for our trip, I specifically wanted something different than the standard blah blah blah. I was traveling with my daughters (20 & 17) as well as my mother. When I came across this tour, I knew it was perfect! Joey was friendly, engaging, and very knowledgeable about the lesser-known aspects of history or what you didn't learn about in boring old history books!  This tour was EXCELLENT!  If and when we return to Philly, we will definitely book another tour!
