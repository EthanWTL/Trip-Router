In a way I'm really not surprised that Jefferson Square hasn't been reviewed on Yelp until now. Even though its been a part of Philadelphia since 1854, it really doesn't stand out as much as all of the other more well known Squares of Philly do in the world today.

While Washington Square has its Revolutionary War history and lively fountain, Franklin Square has mini golf and carousel rides, Rittenhouse Square is alive and well with random liveliness and people almost on a daily basis; and even Filter Square has interesting animal statues; Jefferson Square stands alone with park benches, trees, and not much of anything else. It does have the occasional flea market, movie night, and festival on the good weather seasons. But on most other occasions its practically vacant and doesn't really offer the draw of its other counterparts.

But compared to the others it does bring out the best moments of parklife solitude. Its pretty easy to find a park bench underneath the shade of a tree during the summer, making it the best of the Squares for reading and relaxation. and while it doesn't have the take out options that are the likes of the restaurants surrounding Rittenhouse and Washington Square, or a good burger joint inside the park like Franklin Square does with Square Burger; the fact that the Taco Loco Food Truck is parked across the street does give it the most consistent food option on the cheap.
