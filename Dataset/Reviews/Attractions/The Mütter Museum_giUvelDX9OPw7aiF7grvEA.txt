So awesome! Worth dealing with Philly traffic and being in Philly haha. Parking is ridiculous though. The exhibits and gift shop were great. A lot of reading and very crowded. Give yourself time to wait your turn and read a lot of the exhibits. Very informative and fun.
It's a museum, so, I get that everything is old, but the morbid displays and policies around no photography are both really dated. 

In the age of social media, it's odd to find a tourist attraction or educational museum  that doesn't allow pictures, but the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia is such an organization. After visiting, my guess is that the main reasons are the outdated displays and very limited size of the collection.

Clearly, the Mütter Museum was important a hundred or so years ago as an educational tool for aspiring medical professionals. Now, it serves as a day trip for packs of school kids and Yelpers from out of town seeking a 4-star experience, but leaving in an hour or so kind of bored. We met 3 different Yelpers there and all had the same yawn emotion about the Mütter Museum.

The garden was notably peaceful and well-maintained. It might make a good local choice for some events.

There are many museums and historical sites to see in Philadelphia. This should be among the last on your list ... if at all. The Mütter Museum was totally meh and close to an old-school Ripley's-Believe-It-or-Not exhibition in the digital and higher-educated age of today.
During the time that my husband spent in Egypt on a government contract job, I saw more than my share of tombs and mummies and learned of the process of mummification over and over again. The first ancient mummies were more of an accident, left to dry in an open pit dug in the ground with the hot air, sand and sun preserving them. During the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties, Egyptians probably began to mummify the dead intentionally. The practice continued and developed for well over two thousand years and the results depended on the price you paid for this process of removing all moisture and liquid from the body. 

While Egypt remains the most eye opening experience and country I have spent time in, the Mutter Museum was fascinatingly horrific with the monstrosities and demonstrated other ways of preserving a body. One of the museums oldest attractions is the "Soap Woman", who died of yellow fever in her twenties in 1792 and was buried in a grave at 4th and Arch streets that was loaded with certain chemicals in the soil that turned her to soap. A "Soap Man" buried along side the Soap Woman, is occasionally displayed at the Smithsonian Institute. 

You will find fluid preserved babies and abnormal fetal development in jars as well as diseased human body parts. Horns are growing out of faces and necks, brains of murderers and epileptics. The tallest skeleton in North America of a giant and standing right beside his skeletal remains is a midget. 

Broken bones, fractured skulls, longitudinal slices of the head, showing the brain in segments. Conjoined twins galore have you seeing double and over two thousand objects that were removed from throats of their victims. Don't put a safety pin or a button in your mouth folks. 

Don't scream "holy crap" when you see the giant colon of a man whose abdomen was severely swollen from not having a bowel movement in over a month. He did go to the hospital only to be told he needed to go home and have a bowel movement and he died, because he was full of it. So if you ever start to swell and feel a little backed up, don't wait as long as he did, they retrieved two and 1/2 buckets of waste. 

On display is the tumor of President Grover Cleveland that was removed from his jaw and the thorax of John Wilkes Booth. Brains of tiny animals all the way up to humans, a huge ovarian cyst, a malformed pelvis, testicles and penis are on display. 

The Mütter Museum at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia is a sophisticated high ceiling, two floor gallery that houses this collection of medical anomalies. This collection of skulls, skeletons and body parts is the largest collection in the United States and one of the last surviving.  The instruments used by Madame Curie are displayed as well as others.

Over one hundred and fifty years old it has been used to educate future doctors. "In 1858 Professor Thomas Dent Mutter gifted and presented his personal collection of unique anatomic and pathological materials". The admission is $14.00, if you go to their website you can download a two dollar off coupon good Sunday through Tuesday. Get there as soon as they open, the walkways are narrow and they get crowded fast. No large bags, cell phones on or photography is permitted. 

Disturbingly informative!  Use your inside voices and keep it to a Mutter, even when you scream.
Philadelphians are so lucky to have a museum like the Mutter.

Someone was interested in physiology and anatomy, we spent solid 3 hours here looking and reading at every displays here.

Collection is extensive (from my non technical point of view), and it was very interesting....,

Okay not to me as I wasn't that into seeing brains and skull or any parts of the human body.

I however did enjoy their garden. Each plants has explanation on how they could be used as medicines. It reminded me of Maasai people in East Africa.  They have benches and I just sat there and waited most of the time while others enjoyed inside.

If you are into such things, come alone and take your time to enjoy their collections here.
I've been wanting to come here for years. I decided to hop on a train from the burbs and take myself on a date today. I chose the Mutter Museum to do just that. 16 bucks to get in, they give you a blue tag to hold on to that you can come and go as you please until they close. I do know that they also offer discounts for students, military folk, and seniors.

I loved it. It's small, but there's so much information to read that it takes up a lot of time. I think I was in there for a little over an hour. I made sure to learn everything I could and get my money's worth. I really enjoyed they're presentations in coorelation with the Brother's Grimm tales. I also liked the wall of skulls that each had their own story. The various medical instruments and how patients were treated for things is absolutely amazing. It can get a little dark. They have a lot of unborn babies/fetuses in the downstairs area, which could be hard for some people who may have been through some personal things. They do have some wax replicas, but it's stated clearly what is and what isn't that. There's also a gift shop with some cool stuff in it. 

Definitely a cool place to check out if you're into science, human anatomy, or things of the unknown! I'm glad I went!
I have been waiting for years to visit this museum. I love oddities and general odd things, so a medical museum of specimens is a dream for me. This is a popular place and the museum was pretty crowded. It is a very small and cramped museum and the ventilation did not seem to be able to compensate for the number of people in the museum. I don't mind that so much since it added to the creepiness and mystery of the place. It probably would have been better if they regulated the number of patrons they allow in at one time. I like to take my time and investigate things, and there just didn't seem to be enough space for me to do this. There was a civil war exhibit upstairs which was pretty neat. There were lots of medical instruments on display and stories of war time surgeries and injuries. There was one interactive experiment where you could see what it would have been like to be a solider who lost his arm during the war. Upstairs there was also a display that paralleled specimens & medical instruments with fairy tales. Downstairs is where you find most of the gross and explicit medical specimens. Lots of body parts in jars, lots of skeletons, lots of preserved materials. So many different things, everywhere you looked. Endless fascinating peculiar oddities on display. This is the place to go in order to study and inspect illnesses and diseases at different stages. This was such a special place to visit. If I returned to the Mutter, I would prefer to go on a less crowded day so I would feel more comfortable taking my time and looking at everything.
I really did want to be blown away by the Mutter Museum.  We came here on a cold wet and snowy Saturday afternoon, looking for a nice experience and maybe a bit of having my brain expanded and mind blown.  Sadly I was a bit underwhelmed.

Not the fault of The Mutter Museum, but the crowds were problematic.  The far wall which included the glass case of skulls, how they all likely died (and lived) were cool, but the displays were all choked with people standing and reading.  Because there were displays on both sides of this narrow walkway, it was hard to skip ahead and you either had to wait for long periods of time, or skip this center piece.  

To be fair, all of the displays were put together very well, and some of the displays were excellent.  The young man who had a second skeleton was  well done and touching.  The woman with a true horn growing from her forehead was wild, While the downstairs area was less congested, outside of multiple deformities and oddities, things started to look the same.

There were civil war soldier displays that showed limbs that were shot with guns or maimed in other ways.  Gruesome?  I didn't think so, but I also wasn't very interested.  These, like many of the displays were more of a see it, saw it, move on so we can go.  Likely my own personal tastes, but as some have said, either you like the Mutter Museum or you don't.  I was more luke warm than anything.

No photos of any of the displays accompany this review, because no photos are allowed in the exhibits area.  You can capture photos in the main lobby however, as well as the garden.  Sadly during my visit, the garden was closed, which is a shame because I was curious about it from all the comments.  

We found parking across the street  right in front of the Museum, which, admittedly was lucky for us, but we were lucky!

Long story long, the Mutter Museum is a wealth of medical information, medical anomalies and if this type of material is your thing, you're going to eat this up and give it 5 stars.  If you're looking for a bit more, or aren't really into deformities, well, you may want to skip this visit. 

I was squarely in the middle, and while I did enjoy parts of the museum, I left a bit underwhelmed.  But that's my experience.  Hope you have a blast if you go!
There is so much hype about this place that I could not ignore the siren song any longer. I mean, I've lived in Philly for 9 years now and I had never seen the Soap Lady, for God's sake (btw, I was seriously underwhelmed by her - not enough explanation. How on earth did she turn into soap, anyway?).

So Saturday the boy and I schlepped to the Mutter for a romantic date. Here are my observations from our outing:

1. The trees directly outside of the museum smell like vomit. Seriously. It will make you gag.

2. It's not cheap to get in - $12 for adults. But then again, it's like $10 to see a movie, and there's no guarantee that the one you sit through for 2 hours is going to be any good (tip: no need to see "Rachel Getting Married" at the Ritz. Just Netflix it or skip it altogether. I can tell you how it all goes down).

3. If you go on the weekends it will be crazy crowded. You will get someone's ass pushed up against yours at least 5 times and there will be a line that wraps around the entire joint.

4. It's really, really heavy on fetuses in jars. In fact, there's practically no escaping them and they're pretty disturbing, but not like "ewww, scary" disturbing. More like "this is so wrong" disturbing. At least I felt that way.

5. Beware of the penises and testicles on display. There's a very high cringe factor there, especially if you posses said junk yourself.

6. The skull collection is totally rad and quite extensive!

7. No photos, peeps. It's just not allowed.

8. It's really not as big as I thought it would be. It's 2 floors (really more like 1 1/2) and the whole Presidential exhibit and modern diseases are snooze inducing (Really? An area devoted to washing your hands? Seriously?).

9. It would be really, really cool at night with far, far less people there. Then you might actually get to feel the old timey vibe of the place properly.

10. The gift shop is teeny tiny and looks like it belongs in some Southerner's house (as a Southerner I can vouch for that) with mauve walls and stencils - but it's got some cool stuff. We picked up a poster that's pretty sweet.

Maybe it was just too crowded for me or maybe I had built it up in my mind as something that would rock my world. Who knows. Either way I was let down but not turned off. Maybe I'll try it again on a Tuesday morning or something.
Such a sad place. On exhibit you'll see a number of dead bodies, most of which are atypical in some way; some preserved very respectfully, and others not so much. It's depressing to look upon these deceased people who had thoughts, memories and opinions, just like you and I. The Soap Lady is particularly disturbing to me. Looking upon her distorted corpse leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of sadness on top of the already uncomfortable feeling that is akin to being at a funeral. Bear in mind this entire museum is basically a tomb. 

That being said, the work that was done here is invaluable to human knowledge, since it was a way to catalog a variety of abnormalities that are often quite rare. Some of the older displays do contain some language considered offensive today (I'll let you use your imagination for some of the words that pop up), but at the very least it does give you a glimpse into the past of medical research. If you are not prone to queasiness from gore, or depression from questioning the ephemeral nature of life, then I think you will get something out of this place. I definitely found it interesting, but one trip here is enough for one lifetime.
Listen, for me specifically this place is sorta been there done that, but I don't want to ruin if for the rest of you curious types with macabre minds and dark souls that need feeding. 

If you're all about medical science & history, disease, and mutations/abnormalities galore you'll enjoy yourself. If you have doubts I recommend you visit the website first. 

We went on a Saturday and there was a sign letting us know that we'd chosen the busiest time evarrr! Paid the 20ish per person fees and entered.
 
I had a small bag in my hand (a tshirt from the Penitentiary tour which I highly recommend) and no one said anything about it until we entered the exhibit area where a female security person took a break from yapping with her friend and told me I couldn't bring it in. She stared at me without offering any suggestions. Thanks! After a bit of this I conceded and said "So what do you suggest I do about the bag?" and she then sent me to the desk where the more friendly and helpful staff apologized for not noticing the bag initially, and got me a free locker. 

I was annoyed by the standoff for a few. Security chick REALLY needs to check her attitude. 

The flow is sort of a windy upstairs to downstairs deal and when it's crowded it can be difficult to absorb the detail and content of each item in the massive display cases. I missed a lot waiting for slow readers and groups blocking things instead of moving along.   

The gift shop was great, and I spent too much time playing in the bin o' germs and diseases in colorful and fuzzy stuffed animal form. Who knew Typhoid and Ebola were so dang adorable???

And regarding my initial comment, the impact of the Mutter may have been lessened after seeing the following, all of which I highly recommend...

Museum of Death - LA (Silverlake)
Bodies in Motion Exhibit - LA Museum of Science
Necromance/Memento Mori LA (Melrose)
Mummies - Field Museum Chicago
Museum of Torture (Ripley's) - San Antonio
When the highlight of my waltz into a museum is to make sophmoric comments concerning the size, age, and condition of a green, syphilis-infected penis, you can be assured that I have dropped to the basest form of entertainment.  While I have no question that medical information can be gleaned from the paltry three rooms that comprise the "museum", I felt violated paying $14 to view the offerings here.  

I'll add that I didn't find the museum enjoyable either.  There was an inordinate focus on medical trauma without associated examples of it.  I found the skulls exhibit mundane, and I thought the much anticipated soap lady (which I oddly kept calling the soup lady) was jarringly boring.  Probably the most interesting item to me, other than the unintentionally funny diseased penises, was the comparison between the giant and dwarf skeletons.  I literally spent 15 minutes in the museum before realizing that it was one grand disappointment.  Sadly, I was able to see everything in that short time period.

Maybe my expectations for museums have skyrocketed as a result of living in a city known for having world class ones.  In that sense, I'll state that it's possible that I simply have a misunderstanding of what one should expect to receive from a museum.  But the simple truth is that I would not have enjoyed this museum if it was free.  Despite the glowing recommendations, I would avoid it.
The Mütter Museum is a fantastic place to learn about medical history and the human body that dates back to late 1800s.  The museum itself is not terribly large, but the displays were fantastic including different body parts and various diseases.  Just a tip, they do not allow any form of photography!
With skulls, bones, organs,
Other creepy oddities,
The past is revealed.

History can be
sad, disturbing. I'm left with
a haunting beauty.

Mutter Museum has an excellent collection & is definitely worth visiting. Beautiful venue for a wedding.
.     Mutter Museum-Wow, this place is everything it claims to be.  It is not for the faint of heart.  My goodness I was disturbed by what I saw.  M3edical science has advanced by the pioneers who have dared and had the strength to dissect bodies and parts of bodies.  .  Here in this museum you can see a lot of that type of work.  The museum is small, we went during the back to school rush of local colleges like Drexel and Penn.  This added to the experience because all of these nicely, well dressed young people were pointing out the beauty and amazingly preserved specimens.  To me I only saw the suffering that some of these poor people must have endured during their life.  Obviously I do not have a medical degree, and the students around me were aspiring to earn one.  The wife rushed through the tiny museum whereas I lingered only till I had seen enough to make me grateful for my career choices.  You have to see it once.  It has been on so many TV shows on the discovery channel and likeminded broadcasters.  I have quite literally grown up in museums and have never seen such displays.  You have to see it at least once in your life time.  If you are mesmerized by the macabre, this is a place you will visit often.
Ok all I can say is that this is a very interesting museum. Its not for the squeamish and probably some of the exhibits you would have to do some explaining to the kids because some was rated x. I found this place to be intriguing and very educational if your into the biology and physiology. It explains a lot of the way surgery and things were performed a long time ago. Some may say that some of the exhibits are gross. I wouldn't say that but I don't recommend eating and going to the museum. Hey maybe it wouldn't bother you but I felt a little squeamish at times. I still found everything to be interesting and I was even reading a lot to get the history of most of the exhibits and I am not big on that.
This museum has two levels and expect to be there at least 2-3 hours to cover it all. They also have a gift shop that you enter before leaving. 
There is a parking lot on the side of the museum that charges $11.00 which is not bad at all. They also have a locker room where you can put your things in for one quarter and you will get your quarter back when you retrieve your items. I really did find this to be very educational and not a dull moment at all. Some may call it strange but that's not my take on it. Check it out for yourself and see what you think. I would highly recommend though. Especially if your studying to be a Dr. or health care in general. Just remember pictures are not allowed in the main exhibit area but you can take pictures in the art gallery.
***Medical Museum Worth Visiting but Many Areas for Improvement***

In terms of balance, museum was very heavy on bone and early developmental (lots of fetuses) and old medical instruments. I would have liked to see more cardiovascular and respiratory system pathology, especially given their importance in American healthcare today. Also, I think some of the changes in the heart such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be quite striking visually and would be of general interest. But they aren't as easy to preserve as bones...hence, lots of bones.

Another issue I had is that many of the exhibits weren't really well explained thoroughly enough. Some were, but they were in minority and often had long explanations...maybe try putting a short paragraph or something explaining more of the smaller exhibits? Often there would just be titles of the condition nearby, and it was tenuous to look back and forth and try to match the labels with the corresponding exhibits. Since it's a relatively tiny museum, I would have appreciated more thorough explanations. Sometimes I could reason/guess why pathology developed the way it developed but wanted confirmation or more info i.e. they have a collection of about 150 skulls, but no explanations for their associated developmental abnormalities or defects.

Also it would have been cool to see more normal and asymptomatic or relatively benign anatomical variations. One of my favorite experiences in anatomy was learning about the potential variations in our vasculature, nerve distribution, and organ development. Pathological conditions of the human body can be quite striking, but I think its amazing (and probably not as well known) how much variation our body can handle without our awareness. 

Also, it would be nice if the museum was more spaced out since it can get crowded. The building is beautiful but the museum itself only takes up a couple of rooms on 2 floors...in my opinion the lower one was more interesting.

FINAL VERDICT: Interesting medical museum, doesn't take more than an hour or two.  Would like to see more explanations and non-skeletal system pathology in the future.
I saw this museum on the Travel channel and knew I had to come. It is just full of weird medical oddities, things you can't see anywhere else. I think my favorite thing was the giant man's skeleton. It's HUGE. I do not remember his height but I want to say it was like 7'6"? Something like that. It's just amazing to see a human that big.

They have a lot of babies/fetuses in jars. As a parent, not my favorite thing to see. If you are someone who has had miscarriages/still births, I feel like this should almost come with a trigger warning. I have had losses and it didn't bother me that much but it made my husband sad. 

No backpacks of any kind but they do have lockers to put your stuff ($2, takes quarters only). They have drawers and drawers of things people have swallowed, people like to swallow pins. An entire wall with skeletons with various defects or causes of death. Some of them were marked "idiot" and I thought that was funny until my husband pointed out it probably meant they were developmentally disabled and back then it was more common to just use a slang to describe them. 

It doesn't take very long to get through this, perhaps an hour. It was interesting and I'm glad to have seen it. No photos in museum, because "the dead can't consent".
This has been on my "bucket list" since seeing the museum featured on the history channel.  It has got to be one of the coolest museums we've ever visited; and, one that my daughter was looking forward to as well... my wife not so much, although she really enjoyed her visit.

As others have noted, the museum is full of preserved, sculpted, and modeled body parts; as well as wet samples that are preserved in liquid, displays of medical equipment and items found in peoples' bodies.

If you want to see some of the exhibits without visiting, they offer up a large portion of their collection on the Internet.  We found the museum to be equal parts odd and educational; and, not sensational at all.

We stopped in the gift shop on the way out and picked up a couple of books, a couple of t-shirts, and a couple of DVDs.  We all had a great time; and, the staff was fantastic.
Went on a friend's recommendation. Was cool indeed.
But they have a strict no-photo/video policy.
Security guard thought my friend was taking a photo and warned her.
Then a few minutes later when she was on the phone... the security insisted she leave because the guard thought she was taking pictures again!

This is very easily solvable... my friend offered to show her her camera roll...
But the guard wanted nothing to do with that.
Which pretty much tells me that this person has desperate power issues or something.
Very annoying experience.

p.s. if they are allowing photos at the Museum of Art of priceless masterpieces, maybe you can tell your security guard to ease up on someone using a phone near a pig fetus, ok?
I really could on and on about all the cool shit I got to see in here.  Like, you literally get to see Albert Einstein's brain (well, parts of it) the second you walk in the exhibit.  I wanted to commemorate it with a photograph but alas, it's prohibited. 

Basically, you'll see everything from real human skulls with cool stories (my absolute favorite part) to a giant, coiled colon to fetuses to hair balls from stomachs to gangrene hands in jars to the "soap lady" (the single most disturbing exhibit that crossed the line for me- I just had to walk away).  It's a little gross if you've got a weak stomach but also very cool and informative.  

If you're in the medical field or just love anatomy- this place is an experience of a lifetime and admission is only $16, which is nothing for all the history you get to witness.  The uniqueness and oddities of the place redeem its rather annoying qualities, which I'll get to next.  You don't have to read it, but it's something to consider if you want to make a day trip here:

I took off a star for the way the crowd is handled.  There needs to be staggered admission times or velvet rope queues or a staff member pushing the crowd along.  I spent so much time next to the teeth/jaw section waiting in the gigantic line that snaked through the downstairs exhibit, I started to memorize it.  Like, I get it people, you wanna read fascinating details about the conjoined twin skeleton you're looking at- but like keep that shit to a minimum.  You don't need to read EVERY single thing.  It really backed up the crowd and you could tell people (especially those with antsy kids) were getting impatient.  Also, I wouldn't suggest bringing a toddler here as it could be disturbing for a small brain like that.

The factoids/stories/descriptions were cool....when they had them.  Sometimes, I'd see a whole area that had no facts or diagrams and sometimes I couldn't tell if I was looking at a REAL arm with tuberculosis or just a wax model (cause there's tons of those)...like that little detail makes a BIG difference.  One exhibit even had post-it notes as descriptors, which seemed kind of lazy. It all kind of seemed like a work in progress for the side rooms off the main area.

The gift shop was awesome-they had cool books and shot glasses and brain ice cube trays and plush toys for every disease you can think of.  You pick up this cute pink fuzzy squiggly thing with eyeballs and you go "Aww....it's Pneumonia!" They had HPV, Anthrax, Typhoid Fever...you name it.  And all wrapped up in an adorable package!  Great for fun gag gifts or stocking stuffers.

I would actually come back here to further investigate the stuff I had to graze over or skip altogether because of the crowds.  Maybe during the week when it's not so packed.
If you are a hypochondriac, do yourself a solid and sit this one out. 

This is a macabre place full of more grizzly, ghastly and grotesque sights than the mind of man could invent. (Books bound with human leather, syphilitic penis.)  

Don't listen to what others tell you. This is a bona fide freak show complete with Siamese twins, bizarre fetuses floating in formaldehyde, several persons with the bad luck to have a horn growing from their skulls, and a giant and a dwarf standing abreast for comedic contrast. 

Perhaps there was a time when this was an institution of medical science. And that time is called the 19th Century, when surgeons didn't bother to wash their hands and doctors blew cigar smoke in their patients' faces. For now, step right up, don't be shy! Buy your ticket, and prepare to be amazed! (Or kind of bummed out.)

I admit the museum is pretty interesting, but it ain't exactly a laugh riot. Being in the physical presence of so many horrors has what you'd call the "buzz-kill"effect. Go see it once so you can say you did, but honestly, how many times do you need/want to see a plaster death mask of the guy with an infected eye that never healed and drips green goop?

As I mentioned, if you have leanings toward hypochondria, forget it. You'll walk out worrying if your company's shitty insurance will cover the removal of a horn from the middle of your forehead.
I'm just back from a dash to Philadelphia. Four days stuffing my red bag full of five-star experiences to share with you. 

Let's start with Mutter (umlaut over the u). Pr mootehr. The Mutter Medical Museum, or as it was described to me, the museum of medical abnormalities. Oh how right up my alley. 

People in jars, a million skulls of all manner shapes and sizes, a giant skeleton next to a wee skeleton for scale, a stuffed lower intestine, daguerreotypes of villains and victims, a case dedicated just to a collection of swallowed objects, the lower leg of John Wilkes Booth (bastard), and ... and ... so much more. 

My favorite? At first I thought there'd be too much to choose from. Everything was five-star fabulous. Then, at the end, the penultimate aspect rose to the top. The cream. The gift shop. Yes loveys, this was the frosting on my devil's food cake, this was the coup de grace. 

They had the most wonderful collection of creepy thoughtful presents. Well-crafted meerschaum skeleton lockets, a baby-hatching kit (they come from chicken eggs), voodoo keychains, things made from string. And, goodness, a basket of stuffed little microbes. They . were . so . cute. As were the three kids rooting about in said basket, maybe 8 years old, tops. They had measles and plague and staph infection and bad breath. I thanked my lucky stars when the boy handed his mom the stuffed HPV. 

What's this, mama? 

If'n you go to Philly, after the cheesesteak, after the bell, go get yourself a stuffed microbe. Go stroll the jars and the bones. It's creepy, but so well done.
(This visit was made the week before the initial Covidious lockdowns began in mid-March.  When things return to a look of normality - your experience likely will vary.)

When I look back, it amazes me the difference a few days can make.  Like a lot of people back in March we knew that some kind of lockdown for Covid was coming and that's what pushed us to make a visit here the weekend before Wolfy closed everything up.  We figured it would be awhile until the opportunity presented itself again and who knew what a long strange trip it would be just to get to September, let alone what the next six months might hold?

Let me start by saying that Joe S.'s review from 3/16/20 is more or less what I'm going to be preaching although he is wrong about why the no picture policy is in place.  It's not that the place is a let down in so much as it's a one trick pony.  I don't think the main display galleries ever really change so if you see some of the things they have online do you really need to go in person?  In today's day and age where a lot of people are content to look at pictures or video in leiu of in person, why encourage people to stay at home and get the experience for free.  No money in that.

A few points:

- As mentioned the biggie here is no pictures.  There are signs everywhere and the security guards will forcefully "remind" you if they see a camera or your phone.  I get it.  People don't like that rule, but it's their rule, not yours so don't be an asshat and take pictures in the galleries then post them online.

- Parking can be challenging as the local area has a fair amount of residential on street parking along with some commerical mixed in.  While there are pay lots available I cheaped out and parked for free two blocks away on 21st.  It was early on Sunday morning and I would imagine that during the week it would be much harder to do what I did.

- Like Joe said the place is fairly disorganzied and pre-Covid damn, did they pack people in here.  We got to the museum about 30 minutes after they opened and already there was a good crowd but by the time we left two hours and change later, the upper balcony where the skulls are was immobilized with people all up each others asses and not eveyone was trying to go the same direction.  Total mess.

The skulls, the specimens, the instruments - some real, some not while some things are just down right disgusting and macabre.  Also keep in mind that nothing here is in any sense modern.  You're talking 20th and 19th century specimins, tools, displays and thinking.

While a visit was for a long time on my list of places to see in Philly the itch has been scratched.  Maybe if I were a medical professional or someone with a curiosity for things in this field I would be more inclined to make a return trip or to give our visit a higher rating but all things considered three stars is more than fair.
The last time I was here was over 12 years ago. But now that I live in NYC I thought a day trip to Philadelphia since it is so close-But my main reason for coming to Philadelphia was to visit this museum.

This time I came on a Saturday and it was overcrowded the last time I came here I think it wasn't as popular and I came on a weekday and it was empty (which I preferred). I love medical history and anatomy. 

Love: 

1. The many different kinds of items they have. 
2. It is intimate 
3. A lot of great history on medical information. 

Hate: 

1. The price is outrageous for how small the place is $18.00? seriously for the size not impressive. 
2. That you can't take pictures...except in the lobby. Because the dead can't consent...come on. 
3. Some of the items are not marked well...
4. unless you are 6'6" some of the items you can't see. They need to work on how they display items. Some of us are short. 
5. There are typos on their signage. 
6. When they say the have a special exhibit...it's not that special or that large. 

This will be the last time I come here...I wouldn't recommend of you are a repeat client like I was the second time it is just not that amazing... However it was my friends first time and he LOVED it.
The concept of this place is awesome for sure. The implementation needs serious work.

I'll air my grievances before I talk about what I did like:

1) They NEED to switch to some type of time-slotted tour system where only x amount of people can go in at a time. Currently it's a free-for-all, and the tiny space was so packed that I feel I only got to really see about 50% of the specimens. It was crowded, everyone was standing around not moving/blocking everything and when you did get to finally look at something, you felt rushed because other people were hovering around waiting for you to hurry up.

2) They NEED to get rid of the no-photo policy. They claim it's because of "respect for the dead," but that's obviously nonsense because you've already got the dead on display and charging people to see them... clearly the actual reason for the no photography rule is the fear that if people take pics and share them on social media, no one will want to come in person. Newsflash tho: that's not how it works. Every other museum in the universe allows photography and if anything, seeing the cool photos makes you want to go in person even more. It's 2017 - telling people they can walk through a bunch of awesome stuff but not take pictures of anything is unrealistic and makes for a poor experience.

Okay, so now onto what I did like:

The skull collection was probably my favorite part. I liked that each one had a name, and many had a cause of death listed, which helped to see them all as actual people. There were tons of suicides among the collection, deaths by hanging and even someone who died of "self-inflicted testical removal."

Soap lady was pretty sweet, too. I'm not squeamish at all, so the more corpses you have for me, the better. She still had hair and everything, which was delightfully morbid.

Deformed fetuses in the jars were another favorite. 

Perhaps the best part of all, though, was the gift shop. I didn't buy anything because if I'd bought one thing, I'd have bought everything. Make it an online shop immediately please. Thanks.

EDIT: it is an online shop. I don't think I could be more excited right now.
If Ripley's Believe It or Not and a morgue had a love child, the spawn would be the Mutter Museum. It is, by far, the most interesting museum I've ever perused. The collections displayed may not be for the faint of heart, but I found it to be incredibly fascinating. 

If you're able to detach from what you're looking it, this place is so COOL. However, there was definitely a point when my friend and I looked at each other and kind of morbidly half-laughed at how unaffected we were by the numerous jarred fetuses. 

It's not a massive, sprawling collection, but you could easily spend a couple of hours here. I really enjoyed the various medical oddities and reading the stories behind them. There is a lovely outdoor medicinal garden attached. On a beautiful sunny day, this is the perfect backdrop for your insta-photo and snapchat story. *hair flip*

Perhaps the highlight of my visit was arriving at the museum about 15 minutes before my friend. This allowed me to sit outside the museum and witness the various reactions from the Mutter patrons - certainly a mixed bag of fascination, disgust, and laughter. 

If you're looking for a one of a kind, memorable experience, the Mutter Museum is worth every penny.
Not for the faint of stomach, my concierge recommended the Mutter Museum with the tag: "if you like that sort of thing"; making me feel like a creep for wanting to see medical mysteries such as a 4-foot long intestine and conjoined twins. 

What really made me enjoy this Museum was the attention given to the history of medecine in the United States. Specifically, the focus on natural remedies that the Europeans learned from Native Americans, including lots of information about the Lewis & Clark expeditions! Why only three stars then? Well, it's not for everyone, and not for all age levels. That's why.
Where else in Philly can you go to read up on Siamese Twins, see items that people have swallowed, and pay a visit to a legendary soap lady? The Mutter Museum may not be for the very squeamish, but it certainly does give you a lot of interesting and informative things to see.
While it's very well know for it's medical oddities section, the museum also houses an interesting time-line of medical history. it shows how certain diseases were treated, old medical tools, and how some procedures have evolved throughout the years.
If you were to interview the Mutter museum for the job of occupying 1-3 hours of your time on a free afternoon, it might go something like this:

You: So tell me, how would you describe yourself in three words?
MM: Well, let's see. I guess I would say that I'm unique, kind of weird, and a little bit creepy.
You: Okay, I'm all about creepy. Tell me more about yourself. What makes you so unique?
MM: I possess specimens that you won't see anywhere else. I have everything from shrunken heads to tumors in jars. I have a mummified woman whose adipose tissue has turned to soap, fetal skeletons at every stage of prenatal development, and my personal favorite, a giant colon. 
You: I'm sold on the giant colon. But before I hire you, can you tell me what sort of an effect you'll have on my wallet? 
MM: I like to think that my pricing is fair. I ask only 10 bones from students, 14 from the general public. I may or may not accept real bones. 
You: Great! You're hired. I look forward to being creeped out by you at my earliest convenience.
For any medical professional, this is a must-see in Philadelphia.

There are so many medical specimens to see. If you're here out of morbid curiosity, you can get this done in about 1-2 hours. Those with a knowledge of anatomy can spend a whole day here, to be honest.

We were here during the memorial hair exhibit. A little weird, but amazing to see nonetheless. The pieces for the exhibit were shadow boxes and jewelry made from the hair of the deceased as memorials for deceased family. This was a thing popular in the 19th century.

I won't talk much about the specimens. They are examples of medial oddities, disease, and trauma. Although I've been raving about the mid-shaft femure fracture to anyone that will listen. To see the femur heal while misaligned was my favorite specimen. That and the skeleton of the man with gigantism, and the skeleton of Harry Eastlack (Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva).

Okay dear reader, you have made it this far. There is a complaint from one reviewer about being kicked out after taking a picture. They (the reviewer) makes significant claims against the museum. However, this reviewer out right admit that they saw another person take a picture and saw them be spoken to, then their friend snapped a picture and was escorted out. I'm calling you out. 

You are told that in the museum, no pictures out of respect for the specimens because these were LIVING PEOPLE whose bodies and parts of their bodies on display. Your party was told, then your party saw someone spoken to for taking a picture, then a member of your party went ahead and took a picture. The museum is not at fault, they were not being biased. Your party were being disrespectful despite fair warning. Then you got booted and left a bitter review. Take a step back and recognize you're in the wrong, and stop playing victim. Also no, I don't buy your story. You can wait to leave the museum to snapchat.

So reader, they have cameras. There is security on the floor. They are militant about not allowing pictures to be taken. Be curious, but be respectful. No pictures in the main portion of the museum.
My 13-year old son and I went yesterday. Honestly, we were not that impressed. The curatorial work in this museum is sloppy. The exhibits are not well-explained. For example, there was a cabinet with a brain and a big poster saying "Albert Einstein's brain". Then you read on to learn the history of Einstein's brain, only to find out that is not the brain in the cabinet. Another room has posters about the embalming of Abraham Lincoln, and an embalmed body that is not Lincoln's, and a lot of other non-related things. It just seems like they place "sexy" posters around a lot but they don't really explain what is on display.

Also, the museum is in a very small room and is very crowded. Every time I go, there are slow-moving lines of people to see the objects on display. I think that ticket sales are probably pretty good, so why not invest in a bigger space.

Also, the gift shop was annoying. A lot of the exhibits are the bodies of people who died of horrible things, like a man whose colon became so distended with constipation that he expired. So do we really need a stuffed animal of that colon? The gift shop has one and the staffer is making jokes about it. It seems insensitive and disrespectful.

Anyway, not impressed by this museum. It seems like it caters to cool hipsters with lots of "cool" things but not much context or sensitivity of presentation.
Wow. There's some freaky things in here! 

That's the point though! I had a couple different thoughts run through my head. Well, lots of thoughts ran through my head here. But a couple profound ones (for me at least)...

I'd definitely donate my body to science if need be. 
There is some weird shiz that happens to the human body. 
I'd never take kids here. Their questions would be WAY too overwhelming for me to answer!

I thought the baby section was the most interesting. It obviously makes me sad that they have these real human babies that have passed away, but it was very interesting to see the baby at all the stages of development. Also, the Siamese twins and things that develop in utro are just insane. I think as a woman it was just really interested me. 

I know I'm not a museum curator, but I'd just like to add my two cents as a paying costumer. It was hard to read a lot of the exhibits up against the wall. Some parts of the glass made things blurry, some write ups were in too small print (I'm 90 obviously!) and things were so close together. Since it was so busy it was hard to just stand there and read things. 

But, it was still well worth the money for the things I did read and see. I'd say a must for a trip to Philly!
The Mutter Museum is currently (as of January 2008) looking for a new director.  I hope that when they find a new director, I will be able to give the museum 4 stars.  

Most of the Museum is great.  It is full of medical oddities that will make you stare in wonder and turn in disgust. 

The major problem is that parts of the museum need SERIOUS updating.  I have never been so insulted by an exhibit in a museum as I was, yesterday.  The Mutter's exhibit on "modern" medicine in the world and in the home was clearly made in the early 90s and needs to be rethought.  It is insulting to women and men in its attitude towards the American family by implying that worsening health trends are a result of women joining the work force. 

I would like to recommend the Mutter to friends and visitors, however, I feel that no one should visit until they update their exhibits or begin billing them as historic.
What a phemonminal collection and education museum. Honestly it deserves 5+ but only one issue. I understand and admire how it is set up and it is so very cool but as the museum gets more and more well known  it needs to spread out. The majority of the collection is packed into three rooms and they have other rooms they could use to spread it out and let people really take there time and see everything. 

Ultimately it is amazing that people had the intelligence and perspective to collect these artifacts and preserve them for the future. Any future current or predictive physician in any field should visit. Also any scientist and average person interested in the human condition.
When I was heading to Philly for a few days, friends gave me a list of personalized "must-dos." On it was a visit to The Mütter Museum. I don't know what that says about what my mates think about me, but I'm glad they suggested it!

It's housed in a beautiful building, and - if you're into weird medical stuff and want to be "disturbingly informed" - I encourage spending a few hours here (that's all the time you'll really need to see everything). What to expect?
1. The Soap Lady: am extremely well preserved lady encased in adipocere.
2. A plaster cast of "Siamese twins" Chang & Eng: they had VERY different personalities, so I can't imagine they were the best of friends.
3. Einstein's brain: guess what it looks like? every other brain.
4. The tallest skeleton on display in North America: probably my favorite part of the museum and it's just bones in a case, but at 5'2 I just can't wrap my brain around someone 7'6.
5. The Benjamin Rush Medicinal Plant Garden: I'm a garden geek, so anytime I can look at growing things and see what in nature can cure what in my body... I'm in.

When I went, there was also a really interesting display about body modifications throughout history (as someone with tattoos and piercings I definitely took the time to read through this and study the skin samples), and an exhibit about the Grimm Brothers' (the dark and morbid side of it with physical examples! SO COOL!).

I do think that I would have been more impressed and fascinated, though, if I hadn't visited the Surgeons' Hall Museums in Edinburgh, Scotland first which I think is better (it's got an incredibly impressive - and much more extensive - selection of body parts, it's more interactive, more experiential, and the staff was much kinder). Still glad I got to visit The Mütter Museum though, and if you're looking for something "different" check this place out!
The Mutter Museum is part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which is one of the oldest professional medical organizations in the country (founded in 1787). The museum has a very unique collection of specimens and objects relating to anatomy and medicine, many resulting from autopsies performed by physicians at the Mutter Museum throughout its history. It has wet specimens, skeletal specimens, models, and instruments. 

My husband is a physician, but I am not (I took the bare number of science classes required by my Texas public high school and my liberal arts college), but we both found the museum interesting and worth a visit. I learned a lot. I had been warned that some of the collection might make me queasy, but I was mostly interested and not grossed out and learned a lot from the specimens and their signs. But it's a good warning for people who are a little queasy in general - this museum may not be for you if the sight of body parts preserved would yuck you out. 

The museum isn't large, and we found than one hour was enough time to see and read everything we wanted to. I did find it a crowded space, but everyone inside the museum was mask mandate-abiding when we visited. (Still worth noting if you're cautious about inside spaces that it is a bit tight in some areas.)

During COVID, you must purchase tickets online and in advance. This was the case when we visited in November. It was easy and quick to purchase tickets and plenty of times were available when I looked last minute. FYI: Photographs are limited to the lobby but I really liked this; the specimens in the museum that came from humans who donated their body to science, and I found the non-photography rule to be a matter of respect to their sacrifice to science, not to our Instagram feeds. 

This museum probably isn't for everyone, but I found it really interesting and informative and unique. Well worth a visit if you're looking for a different museum experience and don't faint at the sight of body parts preserved in fluid.
The Mutter Museum ties with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum as "Best Museum in which to Snuggle Up to Your Lover."  It's dark.  It's cozy.  And the placard lettering is just small enough to make leaning in close to smell his/her skin seem altogether innocent.  Really!

Furthermore, there's the simple matter of entertainment.  As far as museums go, the Mutter's high on kitsch, history, and sociological intrigue.  Gawk, if you will, at ...

*  a distended colon roughly the size and weight of Nicole Richie
*  the preparation of brain slices via bagel slicer and ham knife
*  "Moist Gangrene of the Hand"
*  "stomachs influenced by the use of liquors"
*  skulls ravaged by syphyllis ... of Gypsys, child murderers, and a famous Viennese prostitute


And if you fetishize collections the way I do, delight in objects retrieved from choking victims -- catalogued in drawers labeled "Hardware," "Nuts and Seeds," and "Bone."


And what of suicides?  Here, the copywriting really shines.  Various motives include ...

*  "Attempted suicide by cutting [of] throat.  Wound not fatal because of ossified larynx ... Lived until 80 without melancholy."
*  "For the crime of insubordination, died under the most cruel scourging."
*  "Died of self-inflicted removal of testicles."
*  "Suicide by potassium cyanide because of suspected unfaithfulness of his mistress."
*  "Suicide by gunshot wound of the heart, because of weariness of life."
*  "Cut his throat because of extreme poverty."
*  "Died of a dagger thrust."
*  "Shot by gendarmes."
*  "Killed in battle with Austrian sharpshooters."
*  "Cretin."
*  "Idiot."

And though it'll take a while to forget the smell of formaldehyde, if you can stomach it, Capogiro's just around the corner.
Coolest museum in Philadelphia! This hidden gem is full of preserved and modeled body parts; it's equal parts weird and educational. I would not recommend coming here if you're squeamish, easily offended, or impatient. It's a small museum and generally gets crowded on the weekends. You'll get the most out of your visit if you come mid-afternoon or in the morning during the week when you'll be able to move freely and take your time reading each display description. Also, I would not recommend bringing children unless you're willing to explain some "adult things" to them as there are some displays that parent's might not want their children to see. You've been warned!

Pricing is reasonable and discounts are offered to students, seniors, and those visiting on Mondays and Tuesdays. Enjoy!
Crazy stuff in jars
But not a house of horrors;
A Philly must-see

On the surface you might think that if night at the museum was a horror movie it would have been shot here. The Mutter Museum isn't in your face gory or disturbing though, more so educational and tactful.

The Mutter is a go-to spot whenever I have people visiting from out of town. I'm not one to hit up the art museum for each new exhibit, and I don't really get down with anyone who is. This is a great compromise when you don't want to spend a ton of money but don't want to wander aimlessly around the city either.

Despite its small size, the Mutter Museum packs a ton of random, strange and sometimes creepy stuff into that space. Walls of skulls, jars of hands, wax models of STD-ridden faces and skeletons with all sorts of afflictions. More fascinating than some silly Rembrandt or other nonsense.

Best part of the Mutter is it's proximity to Center City. My suggestion: take some family or friends here for the afternoon, re-group in Rittenhouse, head out to dinner and try to forget the things you've seen before your appetizers hit.
I have a somewhat morbid fascination with death and weird, so I love me a good medical museum. Cool collection of skeletons, skulls, fetuses, old instruments, anatomical slides, and other curious medical oddities. And while this museum has plenty of cool stuff to look at, I found that a few things will keep me from going back here. 

If you prefer a packed-like-sardines experience, where you're shuttled along and under a constant barrage of "sorry, 'scuse me" then this will be your place.  The place is not that big so it's just a lot of humans to cram into one space. 

Because it's so packed you have to read the displays standing behind however many people. The glass cases seem vintage, so the glass is warped and makes it difficult to stand in one spot and make out the words from afar.  You would have to squat down to see the lower displays, or go-go gadget up to some how see the ones above you

For the experience, the $18 admission is steep. 

Glad I checked it out, but feel I didn't even see everything bc of the people-sandwich inside. This would be best left to an early morning mon or tue activity.
If you're interested in medical anomalies and bodily phenomena -- a replica of a horn growing out of a man's head! -- this is your kind of place.

The museum is relatively small, and while crowded, you're able to take your time and see everything.  The most popular exhibits are probably:
-- a colon with forty pounds of fecal matter.  (As photos are prohibited, one can buy a delightful postcard of this in the gift shop.  Ok, ok -- guilty as charged!  We wanted to shock our friends.)
-- a collection of skulls, captioned with cause of death, sometimes horrifying.

We overhead a docent say that they have many more artifacts not on display. I don't know if exhibits change. (The aforementioned crowd pleasers are part of the -- ahem -- "permanent collection.")  But nonetheless, this is a one-time visit for me.  Med students take note:  check Mutter out.  You'll learn how NOT to amputate a leg.
I don't often have people come visit me from out of town, but when I do or happen to come across lost-looking tourists in Old City, I ALWAYS recommend the Mutter Museum. It's hands-down my favorite museum in the city. 

So for those that aren't already aware, the Mutter Museum is housed in the Academy of Physicians and is basically a museum dedicated to the history of the medical field and medical oddities. It's not very big, only a kind of small, 2-floor museum, but it's seriously the coolest place in the world if you're into this type of stuff. It has a lot of old medical instruments and lays them out in a manner that let's you see how they progressed, such as their old speculum collection that will make you hug and kiss your gyno the next time your lady-doctor visit comes around. It has an entire wall dedicated to skulls, a body enclosed in lyme which is lovingly called the "soap lady" due to the condition of her body now, and a huge collection of fetuses with medical deformities. Yes, that's right. Human fetuses in jars which some of the most bizarre oddities that you thought only existed in movies. I hope I don't come off as super creepy and weird, but it's the coolest god damn thing in the world. OH and one of my regulars from my former job used to be friends with the skeleton that died from fibrodysplasia. Interesting. 

The gift shop is also contains above-average souvenirs. I found a double-shot glass with a picture of siamese twins on side and the other with the words "Make mine a double!" on it. Come on, how clever is that! :D

To top it off, the building itself is really gorgeous and rustic looking. There is a really cozy parlor area with other small historical medical trinkets to the left right as you walk in. It's just lovely!

Make this your go-to place to see in Philadelphia. Oh and call me when you go because I ALWAYS want to go back :D
What a fun place to visit with friends, families, and colleagues. I've visited this museum twice, with the latter one being with my nursing school colleagues. There is a student discount, we paid $13.00 per person. The entire visit lasted just over an hour. Please note: no phones or photography after a certain point or the "security guard". We took a photo with the Mütter man and headed inside. There is literally a vast range of anatomical exhibits to see, my favorite was related to the obstetrics section. You'll have to visit to find out yourself! There are many... "strange" or "unique" things to see that I can't use words to describe. Additionally, they have exhibits and electronic exhibits (when I visited there was a exhibit about the war and how you would look without an arm) It's well worth the visit. There is also a cute gift shop at the end where you can sign your name as a visitor, I purchased a souvenir of the "giant microbes".
There's not much else to be said here, so I'll comment where I felt things were lacking. But, before I make any comments, I will say that the musuem's contents, overall, were pretty interesting. I normally don't feel sick while looking at things in a museum, but at times I was put over the edge and had to look away (e.g. wax model of a horn coming out of someone's head).

The educational value of this museum is in the fact that medical science during the 18th and 19th Century was based mostly on visual study of the maladies. There wasn't much that could be done other than that. Therefore, viewing this museum as a window into the past was very effective.

It is clear why as of January 2008 they are looking for a new director and it can be seen in the exhibits. The newest room, located in the basement, was installed in 2004 and it shows. Exhibits are well lit, the display placards are fresh looking and descriptive, and the exhibits are arranged well.

However, the rest of the museum has fading placards, pealing away from their dried out glue backings. Some even rest slightly askew in the display or lean against their adjacent exhibit. And the more "current" exhibit on infectious disease (or modern plagues and disease) is out-dated at over 15 years old (citations about George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton (first-term).)

The gift shop sold silly trinkets and really lacked in the way of decent postcards for people to buy.

With a little bit of direction, this museum could be a first-rate attraction. As it stands right now, at $16 for an adult, that is a steep fee to pay. Although, I didn't feel that it was a waste like when I went to the Franklin Institute of (pseudo) Science.
Fantastic variety of medical specimens and an extremely unique type of museum. Returned twice over the years and sadly this time it was worth some feedback. 
Walking in there was an overwhelming smell of vomit. Clearly someone with a weak stomach saw the exhibits and couldn't handle it and rushed to exit/entrance way. No reason why the smell couldn't have been cleaned up and set a bad tone from the beginning. 
Pricey cost of admission. 
There also seems to be no system in which people pass through the museum resulting in stagnant crowds and difficulty in seeing many exhibits. There also hasn't been much improvement over the last 7-8 years since I went. No expansion or interesting visiting exhibits. The guest exhibit was merely photographs of the skulls that awaited us inside the main museum. No reason why there can't be new physical exhibits especially given the price of admission.
Interesting museum. There isn't any other museum of its kind in this city of museums. I did a lot of contemplating as I perused each display of medical oddities/discoveries. The museum is goth-like due to the nature of the medical stories, which is to be expected. You might even get freaked out by some things. Just pointing this out in case it's not your thing, or perhaps, it is. The displays covers about three floors. At the end of your self-guided tour, there's a store to purchase items. Also, there is a garden area to explore.

Good-to-knows:
-Photos aren't allowed
-Parking is on street, plan accordingly
-Entry cost for adults is about $18 as well as discounts for students, seniors, etc.
I don't like gore and horror flicks, I don't watch CSI, and I'm not going into the medical field. And for these reasons I thought I would never go to the Mutter Museum. But I am a professor and many of my students are interested in science careers, and specifically forensics. So, I bit the bullet and planned a trip for us to visit the Mutter Museum. It. Was. Awesome!!

Museums are great for leisurely learning things that could actually end up changing your life. The Mutter (pronounced Mew-tur) Museum is full of medical oddities that peak your curiosity and imagination. There was one exhibit where a doctor had chronicled all of the several types of items he has extracted from his patient's throats. Everything from safety pins to chicken bones, nuts, seeds, buttons and rods.

The old medical tools we viewed made me say "ouch" out loud, and amen for modern medicine, whew! When I think of how people from the past were pretty much guinea pigs for us, it is quite a humbling thought.

The coolest thing was taking a gander at Albert Einstein's brain!! It was just sitting there being all intellectual in the formaldehyde, lol. They said it was 15% larger than the average human brain. And another intriguing exhibit was the Siamese twins with a conjoined liver. I guess it was so intriguing to me because the brothers still managed to marry two sisters, and have 21 children!! 

My students also had a lesson in Forensic Anthropology by Marcy, one of the museum educators. She was very engaging and informative. We learned how to identify if a skeleton was a man or woman and also how to determine what race they were. Super cool stuff! Now I'm ready for CSI!! :-)

If you haven't been to the Mutter Museum, I definitely recommend a visit. Even if you are a squeamish type like me, I promise it's not as spooky as you might think. Besides, it will be fun and inspirational....and it will make you a smarter human being.
Awesome museum in Philadelphia!

I recently spent a few days in Philly and was looking for something new and different to check out. After a little research I stumbled upon the Mutter Museum and knew I had to check it out. Originally opened as a museum for med students the exhibits are now open to the public, but beware, this is not for the faint of heart.

The main floor is not as large as I originally thought it would be, however it is packed with a unique collection of skeletal samples, medical instruments, fetuses and so much more. Outside is an extensive garden filled with medicinal plants and herbs.

Admission is a little pricey, $15, but they offer military and student discounts which is great. Also, there are no photos in the exhibits.

If you're looking for something a little different, and don't have a weak stomach I would definitely recommend swinging by and checking out the Mutter Museum.
Absolutely Fascinating. 

Mutter Museum had me absolutely enthralled from the first exhibit, which was a photography collection of exhibits in the museum.  I found myself poring over the descriptions, which took me back in time through hundreds of years of medical history. The photograph themselves were morbidly beautiful.  I found myself more than once gasping, not at the sight of fetuses and cross-sections of faces, but at the artistry of the photos. 

Having a fascination for crime journalism and forensics, my face was glued to the window of the forensics display. Each piece of the exhibit was accompanied by a story--real life mysteries, and the evidence just before my eyes.  The exhibit on Presidents Lincoln's and Garfield's death was very informative, and presented an interesting medical perspective on a familiar page of American history. 

We had parked the car in a two-hour slot thinking it would be adequate, but found ourselves racing against the clock after the photo exhibit and the first level of the main exhibit. We had to rush through the bottom-level exhibit to avoid a ticket, and I would be happy to come back to finish my tour. 

The layout and architecture of the main exhibit hall is also quite a sight. The main floor wraps around an open center looking down at the lower exhibit, with some exhibits spreading out from the central terrace. 

While it may not be the largest nor the most prestigious museum ever, it was one of the most entertaining and fascinating museums I've been to. There wasn't an inch of it that I didn't enjoy, and for a $14 entrance fee ($10 with a student discount), it was probably the highlight of my Philly trip.
Ive been here years ago for a school assignment when I was in medical assistant training to learn about the human body. After seeing jars of fetuses and other human remains in jars.... it made me rethink what field I was going into, I literally got sick in the stomach by many of the things I have seen in the museum. 

There was one display that had conjoined twins (babies) in a jar of embalming fluid. This museum isn't for the faint of heart. You can learn about medical history and the human body which was really cool.
I'm normally very intrigued by the weird and morbid, and don't think of myself as very squeamish. With that being said, I was very relieved when we left the Mutter Museum after hours of looking at deformed body parts in jars and other medical oddities. When we showed up at the museum on the day after new year's day, we realized that everyone else had the same idea (that or it was the only museum that was open). We waited in a fairly long line and then paid the $18 per person (WAY too expensive for a museum ticket in my opinion). The museum itself is in a relatively small space, even though the business itself seems quite large. 

The first (and really only) thing we noticed when we first stepped in was how absolutely crowded the space was. There were so many people in the space that it was nearly impossible to get through, and definitely impossible to see or read anything on display. I don't know how they allowed so many people in the space, but it was packed, hot, smelly, and unenjoyable to say the least. I wasn't able to see most of the things on display because I couldn't get close enough to the glass. To make matters worse, many of the lights that illuminated the glass cases had gone out, and the item descriptions were so tiny that you basically had to press your face against the glass to decipher anything. 

With that being said, the museum does house some of the strangest stuff I've ever seen. Some of it is definitely morbid, while a lot of it is actually quite medically informative. It's pretty amazing that the items have been so well-preserved. This place is certainly not for the faint of heart, but well worth a visit if you have the time. I would, however, avoid the museum at all costs when it's busy.
This place is a medical student's dream. Think of this museum as the baby of The Bodies Exhibit and Ripley's Believe it Or Not. Displays of gross anatomy with a ton of medical conditions you always were curious of seeing - fetal anomalies like anencephaly, holoprosencephaly, rickets, liver from the siamese twins, massive megacolon, Effects of tuberculosis on the skin and bones, gangrene, tumors, osteomalacia, einstein's brain slices, severe scoliosis, displays of the effects of footbinding and corsets on the bones, smallpox, syphillis, Human skin leather?!, old surgical instruments including a device used for bloodletting, and much more. The museum itself is small, but the displays are quite cramped. The lower level is way more interesting. The displays also note if it is a replica of the real deal. 

Student discount is $10. Expect to spend 1.5 hours here. Take the trolley to 22nd and place is just a block away.
This is a must if you love medical history and gristly and gory things. It's not for those with a quesy stomach.

The Mutter Museum has a fantastic collection of skulls, bones, and other medical oddities. We spent a very enjoyable several hours in the museum poring over the little details of each display. Although the size of the museum is not all that large, they cram an awful lot into the space that they do have. In short, it reminds me an old Victorian library crammed full of curiosities.
i'd seen it on tv, but it really doesn't do it justice. a nice counterpoint to the int'l museum of surgical science in chicago, which is awesome but more technically-oriented. the mutter on the other hand tends to dwell on the gruesome, whether it's a dizzying array of preserved deformed fetuses in jars or a letter ben franklin wrote to his gout. good stuff all around. although, looking around all i could think of was how many things could go wrong inside of you, i've felt vaguely ill ever since.
Another MUST SEE in Philly whether you are visiting the city for the first time or live here and just never ventured over. 

Also, you're not allowed to take pictures in the main exhibit so you won't see any posted.

Uncover what medicine was like some 150 years ago. This place is not for sensitive people: there are deformed and preserved bodies and fetuses, wax models of the signs of different maladies, and an exhibit of HAIR, to name a few things you will see. Yes, surprisingly, there were things that people made with lots of hair, like flowers and memorials that would take years of gluing and piecing together. Most items seem to be from the 1860s as the museum was forming its collection. 

The museum has incredible descriptions and explanations. Some of my favorite parts included visual displays of the stories of the Brothers Grimm, seeing parts of Einstein's brain, and a colon that unloaded 40 pounds of feces. Yep. There is a lot more. This museum is incredibly unique. 

There is also a garden outside in a courtyard with a collection of medicinal herbs (or were previously thought to be medicinal). Inside you can try some of them and learn more about them: like the firestick plant, and the plants from which henna and turmeric are derived. Also, we got to see a baby corpse flower!
As guests of my girl Karen B's wedding at the College of Physicians on Saturday, it was our understanding that we would be able to tour the Mütter Museum throughout the evening. So when my guy and I decided to take a break from dancing and get some science on around 9pm, we were surprised to find the entire museum area devoid of any staffing personnel. We entered through the gift shop (again, no staff = no sense of direction). The only light came from the iridescent glow of the exhibits in the exhibition beyond the shopping area. When we tried the heavy doors that presumably led to the museum - they were locked. A few minutes passed*, and we walked back out to the main corridor and through the next set of doors, which led to the main area of the museum, where all lights were on. 

We only got to peer over the balcony for a moment, where I was able to point out the giant colon to my Mütter neophyte boyfriend, before the lights clicked off. 

To be clear: lights off in the gift shop - no problem. Lights off in a room featuring skeletons - not okay! We yelled and a janitor came in and told us the museum was closed. How 'bout locking the door next time?! 




*In which we may or may not have taken advantage of the unexpected alone time in a museum to make out.
We were so excited to visit this place, and it was a huge let down.  I'm guessing the reason they don't allow pictures inside the museum because they don't want to let the cat out of the bag that it's not that great.  

This place need organized and overhauled.  Picture a few rooms with display cases throughout with absolutely no way to direct the flow of people.  Even IKEA steers you through their store.  It's a free-for-all of people squeezing in and looking at different medical condition specimens.  Depending on which way you go, you may miss something or not know what you're looking at.

On the top floor, the balcony has displays on two sides, so you basically have people going to the left and right, and looking at the left and right sides, so there's 4 potential directions people are going.  Downstairs, it's two rooms of displays, and they actually have drawers to look at things people swallowed.  The problem is, the drawers block other people from walking around and looking.

It's probably great for a doctor or medical student who knows what a lot of the terms mean already.  They could definitely improve the information they provide on each of the specimens.  (An audio tour similar to Eastern State Penitentiary would work great here).  Better descriptions would definitely help.  Who the heck knows what "hydramnios" is or what a "fetus" is?  C'mon.  Explain better!

There's very little organization.  Sure, there's a skull area and a conjoined twin area, but it seems they organized it at first, and as they acquired new specimens, they put them in where they fit.  The was a jar of dried human skin, then somewhere else, another jar of dried human skin.  Why two in totally different places?  Same with other stuff.  Just random.

The Spit Spreads Death area was very timely due to the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020.  It's interesting what they did back then in 1918 with the many deaths from the Flu.

The staff was wonderful and they had a coat check and lockers so you could leave things behind.  If everyone had their coats, it would be even harder to squeeze in and see something.

Do they have cool stuff?  Yes, for sure!  But so much room for improvement on getting people through it in an organized way and explaining some of the specimens.  Total fail on the experience for us.
Unlike any museum you've seen.  Don't visit right after eating; specimens with smallpox might make you lose your lunch.  But there's some fabulous medical history within these walls.  It's not cheap ($12), but out-of-town guests will agree it was the most unique and memorable part of their visit.

It has drawbacks, as some of the collection seems awkwardly put together.  The conjoined twins cases seem more like a sideshow than a medical exhibit.  Maybe an intern could help update it; after all it's mostly news clippings.

There is now a cell phone tour, so be sure to bring your phone with you.  You'll be glad you did.

They also have special events.  Get on their mailing list and be in the know.  They're worth attending.  Otherwise, one visit per year is enough for me and my stomach.
If you get all hot and bothered looking at some spina bifida babies in jars it's time for us to start rubbing our nethers together.

We could maybe do that in the nicely mood-lit room of brain slices and vein plates.

What?  You'd rather hold on to the monstrous colon while I take you from behind?  At this rate I'm going to be so worked up I'll probably jump the gun and start dry humping you against the skull wall.

Get real close and Mutter in my ear.  I want to put your parts in jars.
"Disturbingly Informative", says the banner at the front door. That accurately sums up the experience you get at this one-of-a-kind museum. Anything from (real) gangrenous feet, 2000 items that have been swallowed and recovered from human stomachs (including safety pin, jewelries, bones, and nails), trepanned skulls, femurs splintered by bullets, countless deformed skeletons, skulls, fetus and body organs, slices of Einstein's brain, the infamous adipocere (a.k.a. body "soap") lady, all showing off their "yeech!" abilities for all to see in the name of science.

The security guards must have a field day *everyday* trying to shoo people with their cellphones away from the exhibits. I wonder why they just don't allow photos, as long as we're not using flash light or something. Note to the museum: People will still come to see the actual thing -- I would still go to the Met to see the paintings instead of staring at a postcard :-)

Overall, the collections are compact (don't expect a huge, Met-sized museum, this is only a 2 story museum with a main hall and a few extra rooms), but it's still an excellently macabre museum that will amaze you with unforgettable images.
My love of all things midget and conjoined is well known and what better place to explore this obsession than at the Mutter Museum. A plaster cast of the ORIGINAL Siamese twins? Sign me up!! I could have spent hours in this place but it started to feel claustrophobic after about an hour and woman wearing a huge fanny pack kept bumping into me. Other than that, greatest museum ever! 

They really make little effort to beautify or jazz up the museum; it is what it is. I was particularly enamored with the classroom style video. You know how in some museums they'll play some relevant educational video in a small room with chairs? Well, at the Mutter, they wheeled in a TV cart all elementary school style, and just left it in a big empty room with rows of chairs. The video was a documentary about the museum, taped off the History Channel. Classy!!

There's not much more to add to the other reviews here but I just wanted to add my five stars to the bunch.
Okay, so, I'm kind of a weirdo. I love learning about morbid/unusual things. I've been known to stay up until 4am stuck in a wikipedia blackhole unable to tear myself away from reading about such things. This is the place I was most excited about visiting during our trip to Philadelphia, it was one of the first things we did because I just couldn't wait. If you've been to Ripley Believe It Or Not, it's like that, but with real science.

Hoo boy, I was not prepared. The sheer amount of medical specimens is overwhelming. It was a lot, even for me, a weirdo. Did I want to see a preserved gangrenous limb? 100%. Did I need to see multiple preserved gangrenous limbs, each grosser than the last? I don't know, man. Maybe I bit off more than I could chew. I started to feel a little grossed out at some points, which is something I have only very, very rarely experienced. That's how awesome and packed with weird stuff this place is.

The hair exhibit(which I think is temporary) was super cool and unusual. This was something I had never even heard of before. There were dozens of examples of art made with hair. The garden just outside of this exhibit was also lovely, though there were people just going and touching every plant which made me super nervous(there are signs saying not to and that some of them are poisonous). Godspeed brave explorers, hope you brought cortisone with you.

The upstairs area with all the skeletons was super packed, so much so that it was kind of hard to even see everything I wanted to see. I see some people were really put off by how packed it is, and it really is that bad, but the overall experience is worth it. It's just very unique compared to every other similar place I've been. There are so many exhibits and specimens, and so much amazing information that you'll never have heard before even if you consider yourself a weirdness aficionado.

Overall I highly recommend this place. It's very worth it for the entry fee, and you can easily spend 2 hours or more really looking at everything closely and reading the descriptions. Gift shop is on point as well, I got a saponified lady soap for my friend and some wooden Frankenstein earrings for me. Not 100% sure I'd bring a small child here, they might be kind of terrified? I guess whenever I have kids I'll find out and report back. 

P.S.: They are super upfront about no pictures being allowed. I saw some people trying to be sneaky about it and get called out by eagle-eyed security folks. Don't be a jerk and take pics when you know you shouldn't, and if you're gonna do it don't be salty about it when you get caught. You can find pics online if you need to, and instagram won't die if they miss out on your grainy cell phone pic of a preserved fetus.
Wowza - I am giving this four stars because I think it really is an impressive collection of disgusting oddities, and I can see that it would be a must see for a lot of people (like, people that like gross stuff - real sickos and maybe doctors, they deal with strange and gross stuff all the time).  BUT - this is some freaky shit, and literally, on of the things is a colon filled with you know what, so I am not even exaggerating on that one.  DO NOT eat before you go, and thank me later....
There's a wallet made from human skin on display and a wall of skulls....if you aren't pleased with this place , you are a brat.
If you get freaked out by those horror movies with skeletons and body parts, you would find this place horrifying and like a nightmare. However, if you are a medical student like myself, you would find this place amusing and exciting.

I came here when I was still in Middle School - when I was deeply in love with Biology. My biology teacher told me about this place and I just had to check it out. To cut the looooong story short, it was a love at first sight. Seeing everything from the Siamese twins to every disease known to mankind right in front of my eyes inspired me to know more about it. So here I am, studying about medicine to pursue my dream.

Mutter Museum still amazes me after all these years. I am awed by their extensive collection of rare diseases and skeletons. It is a medical textbook, made more visual and fun! (My idea of "Fun" might be a bit different than your idea of "Fun.") If your kids are aspiring physicians, take them here! Most likely, they would find the place interesting.. or appalling. (Hopefully the former!)
This place is somewhere I've always wanted to visit. I am not scared or grossed out by this type of stuff and I find it very interesting. Although, I think I was so exciting about going to this museum that I actually let myself down. 

Yes, there's a lot of real stuff in it but I was disappointed to see so many wax figures. I understand they can't put certain things on display and it's nearly impossible but I still felt let down by it. Not to mention, it was packed! Even if you wanted to enjoy it, it's hard to because everyone is going in a certain order and you can't go faster than the person in front of you and then person behind you wants to move ahead and you are still discovering whatever you are looking at. It's rather small in here so it's kind of annoying when everyone is wanting to hurry up. 

I still don't understand the no photo policy or the locker policy. I could understand certain things like the babies in jars but a wall of skulls? soap lady? a huge tumor? They are already on display so what does it matter? 

I did enjoy the wall of skulls however. It was super interesting to see the ages and the cause of death for each of the skulls. It was decent but I was definitely underwhelmed.

**Also, I do think they should have some sort of policy about the ages of people coming to this museum. I personally think under 10 is not appropriate and they had TONS of small kids when I went.
Bizarre.
Morbid.
Unsettling.
Macabre.
Unusual.

A place not for hypochondriacs nor for the faint of heart (or stomach, for that matter), but for those that are interested in things* that suit the adjectives used above.  With Philadelphia's rich history in medicine (having the first hospital, first medical school and first teaching hospital), this museum is a perfect complement.

The place is small (but located in a gorgeous, historical building).  Entrance fee is expensive (but it might be worth it if you're into this stuff*; this place has a certain cachet).  The collection needs serious reorganization, and needs more legible plaques, better flow and more information (yet there is something to the way it's set up, like you're looking through someone's attic or basement that is full of cataloged gruesome treasures)

*by things and stuff, I mean all sorts of skulls, medical instruments (or torture devices?) along with most disturbingly, waxed replicas of ailments (tumor growing out of an eye?) jarred formaldehyde fetuses and gangrenous extremities (and yes, gents, some of those include penises!)
My expectations of the Mutter museum were high as it promises "to help visitors understand the mysteries and beauty of the human body and appreciate the history of diagnosis and treatment of disease." There is indeed mystery in this museum, but the real mystery is "why does this museum have so many positive yelp reviews?"  

The museum essentially consists of three rooms and a disproportionate amount of space is dedicated to one unfortunate man's dilated colon which the museum curators so delicately filled with shreds of paper to represent stool.  Additionally, there are  twin 70 lb ovarian cyst emptied and filled with fake hair, each in their own protective cases as if these were precious jewels instead of amorphous boulders. American physicians have a rich history to be proud of, but unfortunately if the Mutter museum is accurately presenting  the challenges of early American medicine, one is led to believe physicians would have been besieged by a plague of conjoined twins. The only attempt at medical education was in the medical intervention section, where I was prompted to enter my race, gender and height while a computer program generated an image of my arm rotting with gangrene and amputated all while I was encouraged to stare in a mirror and imagine this alternate reality. I wish there was an alternate reality in which I did not pay $18 to look through antique, wavy glass at paragraphs tiny text next to a random collection of indistinguishable human skulls.
This was a very interesting and informative museum. If you are in to medical oddities, this is the place.  Its hard to describe a place like this, and there is no photography allowed but has anyone seen that move "Anatomy"? First floor has a wall of skulls of people who died naturally, diseased, or other. On the subfloor has two rooms filled with the strangest body parts like conjoined twins, deformed people, babies and organs. What makes it interesting is the dead body on the way out called the "soap lady". I wont say much about her but its worth the travel.
This speaks of everything Philadelphia is all about:  historic, informative, dark , and edgy all at the same time (it is one bad Mutter F.....!).  Sorry for the bad pun but I couldn't help my juvenile self.  Anyway, go, bring friends, gawk, laugh, learn and enjoy.  Another one of those true gems we are lucky to have in Philly so make sure you patronize and support to keep it alive for future generations.  And one last note:  It is completely fine for children, they'll learn and be fascinated for days.
How can anyone give this place anything short of 5 stars? The museum of medico-biological oddities. I think they have Peng and Eng's skeleton there... Not sure. I developed my phobia of skin conditions after gleaning through one of their exhibits on skin diseases. They used to publish a calendar to raise funds. Too bad they discontinued it for, I think, legal reasons. Bah humbug!
Since my move to Philly 4.5 years ago, this is the cultural organization I have visited the most! Anytime I have friends from out of town visiting, this is always one of the first places I suggest visiting. In addition to the rotating exhibits they have each year, I don't ever get bored with the fascinating medical oddities and beautiful architecture of the building. Also LOVE the renovated medicinal garden outside. On a nice spring day, I would recommend just sitting out there enjoying the beautiful plants and soaking up the sun. 

I know that others have complained about their strict policies but I can understand why they're strict. It's the nature of the elements in the museum and building. Also, the museum space is a bit crowded, so it makes sense that they aren't comfortable with folks carrying/wearing large, oversized stuff. I haven't ever experienced any negativity in their customer service here though...and you know I'm a huge customer service snob! Everyone has always been super kind and friendly. I will continue to support this wonderful organization.
This place is decidedly NOT FOR KIDS. My mom brought me here when I was eleven or so and I was definitely freaked out and extremely uncomfortable. Likewise, when I was back on my own accord about a decade later, some poor little five- or six-year-old girl was being pushed around by her mother, screaming in horror and agony at every turn.

That being said, the Mutter is a Philadelphia treasure, probably one of the most fascinating collections of medical specimens in the entire world. Some of the most interesting include a 40-lb human colon, a woman whose remains turned into soap, and a skeleton from a man whose body grew crippling bone fragments in the place of essential tendons and ligaments.

Take a few moments to examine the wall of skulls. They're all from the late 19th century and from a known population, listed with their age and cause of death. The most chilling one I remember was a tightrope walker whose skull had clearly been smashed from some kind of nasty impact, and whose cause of death was a "broken neck".

Again, NOT FOR KIDS. But with a strong stomach and an open mind, you'll be simply amazed by this museum.
It's really expensive to enter this museum and I have to be honest, I was pretty grossed out and bored for the majority of our exploration. The place was packed  when I went on the 4th of July, but I have a sneaking suspicion most people felt a bit underwhelmed as I did. The most interesting display is in the gift store - the woman who turned into soap.
This was just not my cup of tea. In fact, the thought of having a cup of tea or drinking or eating anything while in this place kind of makes my stomach turn. 

If you're into medical oddities (why, who isn't?!) this place is for you. It's a beautiful old building, and at the beginning it starts with an old room preserved with vintage furniture and antique medical equipment. Ok, I'm liking it.

Then you get to the main room. This definitely isn't a big place, so pretty much what you see once you get in there is what you get. We went on a Sunday when they were having a free day, so it was absolutely packed and we basically had to snake through at the mercy of those in front of us. In my defense, this packed atmosphere might have contributed to my ill feeling.

You will find the things I was expecting--old medical tools, skulls and skeletons--but also some truly gross things like preserved human fetuses, a human head sliced at intervals to reveal the brain inside and, last but not least, a slice of the skin of his face, a jar of picked off skin, molds of various skin deformations, molds of conjoined twins, a tapeworm, a giant colon, a whole set of drawers full of swallowed objects, etc. The one part I did find interesting was the skeleton of a woman in a corset, as I had always wondered if wearing them had a permanent affect on the woman's shape. (Spoiler alert: it did.)

Two closing notes: a) My three stars are less the Mutter's fault and more my own squeamishness and b) The feeling of appreciation for your own health when you walk out of there is pretty great.
I was visiting Philadelphia and after my group was done doing all the token touristy things, we decided to check out the Mutter Museum about an hour or so before they closed. 

This turned out to be a really great idea because I really enjoyed the Mutter Museum. It's not the biggest museum but it's beautiful (the building and gardens), full of very interesting exhibits, and you're not left with this rushing that can happen at other museums. I really enjoyed looking at all the skulls that people can sponsor. It was neat looking at each one, seeing how they each die. They have this great Civil War exhibit (along with babies in jars!) that I also really recommend you check out if you're into history/science. 

It was easily one of my favorite part of the weekend. I can't wait to go back!
This is seriously my second favorite museum (sorry, it was number one till I went to the Titanic museum!) 
This museum isn't for the faint of heart, but if you're into curiosities, oddities, and science.. you can literally spend hours here, and not be bored. 
They just added two new exhibits since I've last visited, and they're both amazing! 
My favorite is still the bottom level, and looking at all the skeletons. Their gift shop is always lots of fun, and has a lot of unique books, plushies, and what not. 

You can see the soap lady, Einstein's brain, art made from human hair, a garden of deathly plants, and lots more!
Five of the strongest stars you'll ever see. Those five stars come with a few minor annoyances. I think the price went up because it's now $18 a ticket. The place is small but the collection is strong. This place has an upstairs along with a downstairs. It was busy when we visited. That made for a cramped area. I think this museum could eliminate that if the upstairs didn't look over into the downstairs... just install a floor for extra room!

When walking in, you'd assume that this place is fascinated with skulls. It's so much more than that. My complaint is with the wax models. I'm paying $18 for a ticket. I'm here for the weird stuff. Give me the real thing! If the wax model is all you have, then don't even bother displaying it!

Odd things like this are right up my alley. I loved every second of this museum. Most people following me knew I was there for the babies in jars. Did they disappoint? Absolutely not! I expected a small portion to be babies in jars, but they had an entire wall and a half of them! Expectations exceeded! Now before you start thinking, "Who is this weirdo?" It's critical to see these babies in jars with varying diseases and issues. It's critical to see fetal skeletons ranging from a few weeks old all the way up to 9 months. It's critical to see a conjoined twin baby skeleton sharing one head with two bodies. You know... for science reasons! If there's one place that the "for science" phrase is most important, it's at the Mütter!

Everything in this museum has a story so you can learn as much or as little as you'd like about everything here. Beware! Some of the stories are terrifying!

I suggest not taking your kids here unless you want to give them nightmares. If you're squeamish at all, you might want to eat beforehand. We decided to eat before and after so use your own discretion. 

One last thing for the people that are thinking about going... please be courteous to others! It gets crowded. Don't be rude when people are trying to get through! 

One of my highlights from here was when I was standing at the baby case. This older guy comes up with his wife and says, "Now here's the good stuff" His wife wasn't impressed. It was too funny!
Severely overrated. Extremely actually. Hence no pictures. 

There are somewhat cool things, yet gross, yeah, it's medicine for the morbid, whatever. I got to see a penis and a vagina. Don't bring your kids. Some of the people are very shallow also, man, this place is a letdown. 

However! If I was able to rate the cashiers at the gift shop, I would do 5 stars. Yeah, I can be shallow too, and the reason for the 3 stars and not just 1 (Thank you girls!).

Outside, to the right, there is a small garden that is very quiet and pleasant.
If you want to learn about and see a 3 floor display of conjoined twins, dead babies in jars, diseased organs, deformed babies, eye infections, human skin wallets, gyno tools, human skulls on display and pay for it too, this place is da bomb! You'll walk away much more ejumacated that you were..and maybe you'll learn how to spell too, but that's stretching it buster! I'm starving now. Aren't you?
I lived a block away from here, but I've only been here once?! And that trip was a long time ago, when I lived in Point Breeze. This place is a must-see for people who are fascinated by the strange and unusual. If you're into stuff like Ripley's Believe It or Not, you should definitely check this place out.

I feel like this place isn't big enough, but take your time, really look at all the exhibits and tumors, and oddities. I agree with adding some sort of guide, although it really isn't necessary. I like to move at my own pace! 

Stop on by on your way down to Parkway. It's not expensive and unless you get easily grossed out, you'll totally love this place!
I spent about 10 solid minutes of uninterrupted eye contact with the skeleton of a 25-year-old female with scoliosis thinking, "Would we have been friends? Is that what MY bones look like? Proper dental health really IS important!"

If you have $10 + a 'valid' student ID, it is definitely worth an hours exploration. Its an extensive collection of medical oddities from preserved slices of the human brain, to stunning medical illustrations from the the 18th century. Between the collection of human-leather bound books, the 7ft colon, and the fetuses (SO MANY fetuses), this museum is not for the squeamish... but its great for the curious.
first of all. EW.
second of all. AWESOME.
this place has slices of body and brain, kinda gross, really creepy, but soooo interesting
there are so many odd things here, i think i could spend hours just walking around and oohing and aahing.
The Mutter Museum is not a place that I would have ever visited without my ladyfriend.  She works in the medical field and loves going to any museum dealing with medical history or medical oddities.  The Mutter (pronounced like Mute-er and I still keep saying it wrong) is not for the squeamish.  One lady brought her younger kids in and the security guard told the kids to only look at things they were comfortable with and ignore the things they weren't.  She should have given me this speech!  It's really not that bad but I get nauseous watching an episode of ER or House.  

The 1st part of the museum, you are allowed to take pictures but once you go to the 2nd part, it is completely off limits and there are security guards always walking around.  The 1st part has rotating exhibits which currently has a bunch of art made from people's hair.  I wasn't overly impressed and rather grossed out that this was a thing.  From there, you can go outside to a courtyard named after Benjamin Rush.  It's just a small garden with several medicinal plants.  

This is when you go into the main part of the museum which is smaller than I expected but it is jammed pack with skulls, fetuses, organs, pictures and other exhibits.  You can spend hours reading over each and every item (I would have needed a barf bag if I did this).  They have several skulls which you can adopt because everyone wants a skull from a suicide victim named after themselves.(Sarcasm)  Slightly morbid.  Towards the end they currently have a Civil War exhibit that was probably my favorite part.  They had a brief timeline of the history of the Civil War then go into the various illnesses and injuries sustained during that time.  

After that it's just like all things America, ending in a gift shop.  In case you need a refrigerator magnet of a skeleton or a cartoon pillow of your favorite organ.  The had kidney, spleen and even a testicle....seriously.  Definitely worth a trip
I had always wanted to go here and on a recent trip to Philly on a Sunday morning with nowhere else to be, we took the plunge, and I recommend others do so. We arrived right around 10am and it was a good time, we were one of the first people in there so were able to see everything without waiting for people to move (except the skull collection area, seemingly everyone wants to gawk at them for a long while).

The building is beautiful, and even though the space is small, there is the perfect amount of things packed in. 

Exhibits were extremely informative, and if you are interested in the human body and you are not freaked out or "ugh no I just can't" about fetuses in jars and tumors and dried bodies - then this museum is for you. Oddities galore, but it isn't just a freak-show type of feel. There was a reason these abnormalities were studies and that is evident in the write-ups.

Dinged one star because they should regulate how many people are let in at once. By the time we left, I would have been mad if I were inside with that many people. Also, many of the lights were out in the museum, around exhibits or otherwise. It added to the creepy, dusty feel but it should feel like a museum, not a serial killer's attic.
This place left an indelible impression upon me...I can't get the giant colon out of my mind...four years later. Can you imagine not having a bowel movement for years? Just thinking about it makes me feel funny.

The Mutter museum is a must-stop on any trip through Philly. Full of anatomical anomalies, ancient specimens, and long and exhaustive descriptions of malformations and diseases of all kinds. 

There are permanent exhibits as well as temporary ones. If you are lucky they will profile some horrible tropical disease. When I went there it was a Lewis and Clark thing. There are great souvenirs to bring to friends and family, including a calendar that your friends will either love you or hate you when you give it to them.
I was in HEAVEN here.

For a girl who's obsessed with leeches, has had a kitten fetus in jar collection, and could not get enough of parasitology class, this place was up my infectious disease loving alley.

My equally anomaly loving friend told me I had to pay a visit to this museum and I wish she could have been there with me especially to get giddy over the 6 shelves of trephined skulls from peru.

If I was a siamese twin I think I'd want to be Omphalopagus.  

Go and learn a ton or maybe just try to get through without tossing.

Also stop into the medicinal herb garden next door which is lovely and cute.  
(not as lovely as President Grover Cleveland's hard palate tumor though)
As a FO-SCI (Forensic Science) major, this has been on my museum bucket list for as long as I can remember. Never having been to Philly before, I was pleasantly surprised that it happened to be 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel!!
I could already feel the excitement and influx of knowledge just walking up the front steps! Admission is $15 per person (I believe there is a student ID discount but I am unsure as to how much). There is no photography allowed which is good so you can experience the wonderful exhibit without having to wonder which medical anomaly you want to post on Instagram. 
I especially loved the Hyrtl Skull collection, forensic anthropology has always been an interest of mine, studying bones is such a fascinating way to see the history of an individual. I was sad to learn that the Soap Lady (body preserved by adipocere formation) exhibit was under construction, but there was plenty more to see! Overall it took a little over an hour to look through the whole museum. They even have a cute little gift shop with unique souvenirs! From abnormal ovarian cysts, to all the bodily deformations you can possibly imagine, this place is a definite MUST. You just have to come by and take a look for yourself! :)
Warning: Eat first before coming here or you will lose your appetite. This Museum is not for the weak stomached or the faint of heart. This museum houses an astonishing amount of Philadelphia's medical oddities. Some of the exhibits include skeletons of Giants and Midgets, Cyclops fetuses in formaldehyde, grotesque human deformities and drawers of things that have been swallowed by humans. The only thing I found fascinating was the oldest medical tablet that came from Sumeria. (The oldest known civilization that has no known origin)

Tip: Visit the museum on Mondays, Tuesdays, and  Wednesdays and get a printable coupon on their website.
When is a museum not only a museum? When it is the Mutter. Everything from a Summer Beer Garden to lectures from forensic pathologists to the amazing photography of skulls. A single visit will not disappoint, but stir up more curiosity. Membership could open up the world of medical macabre to all.
Home of the good, the bad, and definitely the ugly!

I had never been to the Mutter until my husband took me a few months ago and, although it was crowded since it was the weekend, it was a ball.

I have never seen so many boils and cracked skulls in one place before! This place id not for the squeamish and if you are I'd wait until after you were finished to eat.

They even have a store with some great photographic work of their displays and lots of kiddie toys to keep grown ups like me occupied for hours. We did, however, miss the exhibit of Ben Franklin's kidney stones. Bummer.
Super super super cool!! I loved my visit here. They have so many cool things to look at and to learn and many different and rare cases of rare medical conditions and diagnoses. For someone in the dental field I found the dental portion of the museum very cool to learn and read about. They also have a section of over 2,000 items that had been accidentally inhaled or swallowed and I was really amazed at some of the things. There was also a special exhibit on human hair that I found very fascinating. The history and creative minds behind some of the art were awesome to see and learn. Great place to come and learn more about the human body and just some of the things that could go wrong. I would definitely recommend spending a few hours here. The collection of items and the curation of those items is unbeatable. No photography was allowed anywhere in the museum out of respect for the deceased who have chosen to donate their bodies in the name of science.
The Mütter is one of those like it or hate it places, I reckon. Me, I hate it but I'll give it its due - the museum is fairly extensive and has a lot of truly noteworthy specimens and exhibits.

But I really don't care to view twenty - or however many - different human deformities and thirty - or however many - different ways soldiers died or were horribly maimed in the Civil War, all exquisitely displayed. To be fair, those two things are just part of the museum's attractions. 

While I characterize the displays as exquisite, many were hard for me to appreciate with the accompanying text using too small font and dim lighting. The distance behind the glass was just enough that my reading glasses weren't effective. Also, some displays required you to fire up the museum's app to get the audio presentation - no written explanation was provided. I do not care to go through a museum with my phone glued to my ear, even though it would have solved the difficulty I had reading the text.

So, if none of that bothers you, it's a four or five star museum. If it does, you're looking at a two star experience at best. I actually quit and retired to a lobby sofa to wait while my wife finished touring both floors. She thought the museum was the bees knees.

Parking is ... difficult. Or it was for us on a Saturday morning.
My boyfriend took me here on our second date. No, seriously. Somewhere near the diseased appendages, I realized that this could be something great...

This place is REALLY cool if you're into medical oddities. Highlights include the skulls of people in different countries (with their occupations--that was really interesting), wax woman, and, of course, the giant colon. I like how it's all just kind of there with not much organization and no signs like, "GIANT COLON THIS WAY" You just kind of stumble on each thing which makes it a little more fun.

Slight cons: some of the stuff gets repetitive (I've seen more fetuses than I need to for the rest of my life, thanks), some of the stuff is just wax structures representing the real thing (disappointing) and it's all really smushed together, so if there's a crowd, you're going to be waiting a while to see everything. However, all these is made up for by the fact that this is probably the most unique museum in Philly.

As others have said, don't expect Ripley's Believe It or Not. Some of the stuff is similar, but it's all presented in a respectful way, in a medical context. This doesn't make it boring, but if you read the information next to the exhibits, you can get more out of it (assuming you understand the terminology.)

The giftshop is cool, too! They have little stuffed animal-type things in the shape of diseases they represent. Adorable in a germophobey way!!

A final word to the guys: don't take your date here unless you're sure that she's a) not queasy around medical oddities and b) really really into you. Luckily for my boyfriend, I passed the test.
During my senior year in high school, I showed interest in only two subjects: English and Anatomy. 
I was that nerd in class who would read chapters ahead of every other student in my Anatomy class. I could tell you that the whatever bone was connected to the whatever bone way before any other kid in my class could. I even started to annoy myself when I began getting A's on all of the exams, even making my best friend who was destined for med school a little bit jealous of my nerdly smarts. Funny, because I was quite the average student otherwise. 
Because of this little nerd factor, The Mutter Museum blew me away the first time I visited. I think I read every inch of everything that the place had posted on the walls next to the exhibits like the woman whose body had decomposed into soap, the 40-foot colon, the giant's skeleton next to the midget's skeleton, and what I like to refer to as the "Wall o' Skull" that features little captions under the skulls that tell you how the skull's owner died.  
Needless to say, the Mutter Museum is not for the squeamish. It's for people like me, who discovered their inner nerd in senior year Anatomy class.
Fantastic museum. I have always wanted to visit, having read about this place a decade or two ago, but never seemed to make it there when in Philadelphia. Well, today, that's in the past, because I am happy to say that this is an incredibly beautiful collection housed in a classic Victorian setting. The wooden cabinetry that houses all of the specimens is absolutely stunning, and highlights the numerous specimens the museum has to offer. The ossuary specimens are impeccably preserved, and of extremely high quality - an enormous amount of work has gone into preparing each and every specimen on display in this collection.

While glass jars filled with polycystic kidneys, preserved hearts, and numerous other specimens are interesting, the real beauty of this place is its history - I was able to see President Grover Cleveland's maxillary resection specimen and slides of Albert Einstein's brain! What a fantastic journey through the annals of medical history.

Another real treat are the numerous surgical kits you can examine. I have always enjoyed their "steampunk" appeal, and the history behind these specific kits is impressive.

Unfortunately, (or fortunately?) they are in the midst of adding a new exhibit, and a section of the place was closed off - guess I'll have to come back for more!

Will definitely be back!
I always worry about parking wherever I go but this place I always found street parking easily. 
I came here twice. First time i was as excited as the second time but I think I have enough for now. 
They have so many items in display. Some are gruesome if not most! But it's a good learning experience. It's a small museum but it can take up quite a lot of time because there are lots to see and to read. Worth a visit if you're in town. 
There are drawers of stuff that surgeons got out of people's stomach! Weird as heck!
I came here Labor Day weekend on a Sunday afternoon but this place was packed! I wonder if it's usually this packed on a Sunday afternoon.

I see a lot of people from out of state leaving reviews for this place. If I were visiting Philadelphia for a weekend and needed a list of places to visit, would I include the Mutter Museum as a must go? Probably not.

The museum is small with only two floors, a rotunda like room upstairs, and a floor downstairs. I did ended up spending two and a half hours just browsing and reading through the exhibits, and I do mean READING. I was disappointed in the quality of the exhibits and expected more exotic things to actually "look at" not "read through". A good amount of the exhibits were only models or casts of something that existed at one point in time but weren't actually the real thing. Even the "real" stuff tended to be something mundane like a human skeleton or a lump of grey tissue in a jar that turned out to be some supposedly abnormal body part. I say "supposedly" because it wouldn't have made a difference if they had put a normal body part in a jar--everything just looked mis-shapened, and half decomposed after it's been sitting in a jar for decades. There were even some really common place stuff like a model of a horse's leg or wet specimen of a pig's organ (a heart or kidney or something, I forgot). Really? Why do these things even belong in the museum? I can go look at a pig's organ in the meat section of a grocery store and I can go look at horses on a farm. Basically, a lot of the exhibits here are stuff you don't really need to come to a museum to see because looking up pictures off the internet or watching a weird documentary on Youtube will give the same effect.

There were also a lot of plaques and descriptions that weren't labeled clearly as to which display they referred to. It would be better if specimens were clearly labeled with numbers instead of described as "bottom left" or "top". I got this impression that the exhibit items acted like props to serve the walls of paragraphs when it really should be the other way around. Even the famous slices of Einstein's brain weren't that interesting to look at. Really if you didn't read the description next to it, you wouldn't know if it was Einstein's brain or that of a random no body.

There were some curious oddities in the museum though, just not THAT many as expected. My favorite exhibit was probably the Teratology section with all these development abnormalities and birth defects. Those exhibits don't require too much reading because they were actually interesting to look at. You'll see enough "real" dead babies in jars here to last you a lifetime. I would definitely recommend you taking a guided tour because it'll save you the hassle of reading through all the exhibits.

In comparison to a similar exhibit, I much preferred the Body Worlds exhibit with the plastinated cadavers. I saw that in Manhattan although I think Body Worlds was at the Franklin Institute at one point in time. I was more impressed with the quality of the specimens and the presentation. There were more stuff to look at without having to read walls of text everywhere. Plus, the Body Worlds exhibit featured all real cadavers and body parts, none of the silly wax and paper mache models.  Of course there's definitely a price difference in admission.

Overall, I left the Mutter Museum with a morbid sense of gratitude that no matter how sucky I thought my life was, at least I lead a better life than some of the dead things in the museum did. I was lucky enough to not have been born with a cleft lip, three eyes, no anus, flipper arms, and one foot! While most other museums leave me with a sense of fascination or inspiration, the Mutter Museum just depressingly reminds me that valar morghulis.
aka the goose bump museum or is something crawling up my leg museum

I had to convince my wife to go there and in the end she loved it. She even bought a lithograph print from the gift shop of a skeletal image of Siamese twins to frame and put on the wall, how macabre is that.

This place is like a medical book of oddities brought to 3D life. Some of the more interesting things were the collection of skulls, the soap lady, the Siamese twins of course and the cross sections of the human head. I felt like I had to look behind me all the time for any kind of spiritual presence. 

The museum is a little pricey ($12) for such a small museum, they should use some of that money for a better ventilation system as it got a little stuffy at times with all that death around you.

Thank You Mutter Museum for bringing medicine out of the dark ages.
Disappointing, expensive, and the no-pictures policy is unfortunate.  As a physician I will note that the skulls from persons of various backgrounds, ethnicities, and causes of death were intriguing.  It was also interesting to see manifestations of disease that we're quite unlikely to see in modern medicine in the United States (Pott's Disease, Tertiary Syphillis, adult Toxic Megacolon.)

What was lacking were real life models as opposed to plastic and vinyl teaching models, friendly clerks, and quality of descriptions on the plaques.  Additionally, if you are going to offer dial-up guided tours but then yell at persons you THINK may be taking photos, why not just do the smart thing and have automated tours like the Renoir exhibit or Eastern State Prison?

Overall I liked Body Works better - many medical texts could give someone a similar experience to the Mutter.
