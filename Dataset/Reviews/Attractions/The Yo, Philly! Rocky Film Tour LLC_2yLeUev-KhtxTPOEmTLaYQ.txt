Any Rocky fan must do tour!!! Mike did an incredible job on the tour. He picked us up in a 7 passenger van. You can have up to 7 people on your tour. His likeness to Rocky is uncanny. He is very knowledgeable on all the films, history of Rocky and all the stops on the tour. The tour was a little over 3 hours and by half way through it felt as if we had known Mike forever. He is very personable which made the tour that much more enjoyable. Stops included Mickey's gym, Rockys apartment, the pet shop, Father Carmines, Rocky steps and statue, the cemetary with Adrian and Paulie headstones, Adrians restaurant and many streets and landmarks in the films. I highly recommend Mikes tour. Great tour and great guy!
