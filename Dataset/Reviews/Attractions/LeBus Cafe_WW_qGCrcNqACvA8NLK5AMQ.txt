I'm pretty sure this coffee shop compromised my credit card (as myself and two colleagues had our cards compromised at the same time and the only place we all used our cards was here).  The cashier swiped the card up and down. Visa says whoever stole it had a card stealing mechanism they ran the card through.

Beware of this store. If you must shop here only pay in cash.  Better yet - avoid.
You have to be a special breed of masochist to buy a croissant in an airport terminal and expect a pleasant surprise. But sometimes, a long layover will do just that to you... It will fill your head with nonsensical thoughts that eventually drive you insane. Sort of like a cricket infected by a hairworm. You don't know what I'm talking about? Well, hairworms are parasites that infect crickets. Researchers at the CNRS in France found out that the hairworms secrete mind-controlling chemicals that cause the cricket host to go towards light. The cricket then jumps into a body of water, because of the moonlight reflection on the surface, and subsequently DROWNS. The hairworms then get out of the cricket, chill around, and reproduce. Anyway, you get the idea... I am the cricket here...

- LOOKS (1/5): The croissant is not even trying. It looks like it survived a nuclear holocaust. As a matter of fact, I am sure it would make a Geiger counter beep, had I brought one with me... If this croissant could smirk at me, believe me it would. If it could talk, it would say "poor little cricket Nathan! You hungry, boy? Why don't you have a BITE!" And then it would laugh histerically at my face while I gag on it.

- TASTE (1/5): The outside layer is dreadful enough that I still wonder to this day why I even bothered to explore the inside of that thing. What can I say... The pictures say it all: this monstrosity is drier than Aleppo after a US intervention. They might as well have filled my pastry with dry sand. C'est la vie...

- REGRETS (5/5): This café calls itself Le Bus. Named after a bakery or something... Le Bus... What kind of French nonsense is that!? Le Bus literally means "The Bus". This is Tarantino levels of comical: what do they call a Big Mac in France? LE Big Mac. Yes, Le Bus is literally the worst name for a pastry café. Maybe it was a sign all along that the croissant quality would match the name of this fine establishment. Well, I'm throwing this croissant under Le Bus! Hahahaha, get it? Under LE BUS!! Hahahaha! Haha... haha...... ha............

- VERDICT: Le fml
Don't waste your money! If there was less than a one star rating I would give it to them. The only thing good was the coffee. Ordered a bacon egg and cheese croissant...run away! Ice cold eggs, soggy bacon and understaffed. Couldn't even eat the croissant. Awful.
