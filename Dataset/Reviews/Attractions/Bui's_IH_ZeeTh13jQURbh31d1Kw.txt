Bacon, egg, and cheese. Enough said.

Been at Penn for three years and I come here a couple of times each week for a quick breakfast/lunch/I'm hungry moment.

Bui's has some pretty solid specialty sandwiches (e.g. Ms. Bui), but none of them beat the simple perfection that is their bacon, egg, and cheese. If there is one specialty sandwich I would recommend though, it's the Turkey BLT...the amount of turkey bacon they put in there seems extremely generous.

Quick tip: If you have no idea what the dude is asking you after you place your order, he's most likely asking if you want "salt, pepper, ketchup" on your sandwich. :)
When I first started at Penn, an alumi gave me the full day Philadelphia walking tour. We started with a breakfast sandwich from Bui's.

Now, being a CA transplant, I had NO IDEA the amazingness that sausage, egg, and cheese could become when served truckside. Seriously amazing.

In my three years in Philly, I've sampled and tasted my fair share of sausage/bacon/egg/cheese sandwiches, but I always come back to Bui's.

The BAGUETTE! They're Vietnamese after all! They know a thing or 2 about banh mi! So the roll is toasted perfectly, the sausage comes in great portions, and always say yes when they ask "salt, pepper, ketchup?" It really is the only way to go.

Now I've moved further from University City, but I sometimes come up here just for a breakfast sandwich. I love it so much I take all my visitors to try this sandwich AND I haven't tried a single other thing on the menu -- I just can't get over this sandwich.

Definitely the best breakfast option out there, from a girl who doesn't usually like breafast or eggs!
I love the grandfather who works here. He's always smiling!

Another of the food trucks on 38th between Walnut and Spruce (closer to Spruce), Bui's serves hungry college kids, specializing in the hung-over category. Home to probably the best steak eggs & cheese sandwich (onions optional) on campus, Bui's has great bread (crusty, yet soft), quick service, and loyal customers. The sandwich is large and filling. I normally get mine with salt-peppa-ketchup & hot sauce. 

**Tangent**
Sriracha hot sauce is hands down one of the best hot sauces out there. I highly recommend you getting a bottle of this Thai hot sauce. It's much better than any-old, boring tabasco. 
**End Tangent**

Another enjoyable sub is the Mrs. Bui's--a grilled chicken sandwich with tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. It bears an uncanny resemblance to Hemo's grilled chicken sandwich, however the sauce is spicier, and typically the wait is shorter. I think it's a good substitute and change of pace from Hemo's.

Estimated wait time during lunch hour ~10-15 minutes.
I skipped another session of gym today because of this. Went straight after work in early morning around 07:30.

Parked my car couple feet from the place. Get off from the car. Walked fast toward the food truck. Saw the menu. Did a little happy dance in my mind. :D

Number 5! THE Hangover Special. egg AND cheese AND bacon AND ham AND sausage AND salt AND pepper AND ketchup. Mixed them all up and put it on the soft warm roll. Total cost = $5.00

The service was very quick. About 2 mins. The lady that was working that morning was very friendly. She offered me if I wanted hot sauce on it. At first I said yeah.. and she asked me again to make sure. And I said yeah the second time. Couple second later I decided not to put the hot sauce haha.. I'm such a wimp. Anyway I asked her not to put the hot sauce no more. She smiled and said.. 'its too early in the morning eh?' .. I just smiled back and said yeah.. Well the truth is.. I wanted to get the actual taste.. without the spicy flavor on it. Next time I'm going there, which is pretty soon, I'll order one with the hot sauce on.

Dude.. you need to believe this.. it taste awesome. Like I'd go to this place if I want breakfast sandwich than going to McD, Wawa or alike.

I'm not sure if I want to try something else from the menu.. Don't get me wrong, they all sound good. But I'm already in loved with THE Hangover Special.
Finding Bui's closed at 8:15am, we called the number on the truck and were told that they would be opening in fifteen minutes. After contemplating finding another place to grab breakfast, we decided to cruise around and wait it out. Boy am I glad we did!!

We had the Hangover and the Mrs. Bui sandwich, both solid, Mrs. Bui exceptional. It was one of those experiences where my eyes widened and I found myself uttering a progressively louder "yum...YUM...!" with every bite.

I think it says a lot that the best cheese steak sandwich I've had in Philly was at breakfast, from a food truck, made by a Vietnamese gentleman. And it only cost $5.50 a sandwich.
A friend recommended Bui's after he heard me raving about Lyns...I will now only rave about Bui's. 

Simple concept: egg sandwiches on hoagie rolls. What sets them apart: Lots of ingredients (no skimping on eggs or veggies), fresh veggies (tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach) and of course, the famous special sauce (mix of mayo / ketchup). For $4.50 you get a huge, delicious and warm sandwich - perfect cold day fix. 

Can't wait to be back!
Yes indeed, the only thing I've ever purchased from Bui's is the egg sandwich.  Fresh roll + perfectly cooked eggs + made to order + *cheap* = bliss.  I keep it simple: egg whites with cheese on a long roll.  They don't look at me funny if I ask for just 1 piece of cheese or black pepper.
One of the keys to Bui's breakfast sandwiches-- they toast the roll. Giant $2 lightly crisped egg and cheese sandwiches (available at lunch time too- they don't run out of eggs and force you to buy cheesesteaks after 11am).

They will also remember you and your order -- one of my friends will show up in the crowd and they will start making his sandwich (egg & cheese with sausage) when they see him.
I had the pleasure of being introduced to the Bui's food truck through friends that went to UPenn. They raved about the breakfast hoagies and they were right!

The truck opens very early and it always smells so good. Simple menu, I love getting a sausage, egg, and cheese with salt, pepper, ketchup. It's a large portion, enough for 2 sausage patties and the egg and cheese is nice and gooey. Even with its size, I could go for 2 sandwiches because the taste is so great. 

The Asian couple running the truck are nice and efficient. It's a no hassle operation and great bang for your buck. I wish I had this food truck out in California. 

Always a stop when I'm visiting Philly and need a more-than-satisfying breakfast hoagie!
Hands down, the best egg sandwich in West Philly, maybe even in the city. Only Bui makes it just the way I like it 

whole wheat + egg whites (spelled "eggs white" on the sign) + sriracha

so fast, so cheap, so delicious, I can't get enough, and I rarely order anything else. Spinach is a nice addition, though, if you need some more vegis in your day.
Breakfast sandwich is
Pretty good and comforting
I'd eat another
The bacon, egg, and cheese on baguette is amazing.  Truly.  If I lived in the area, I would be here quite often.  It's literally pure happiness in a sandwich.
in two words:  THE BEST

in a few more words:  this place is an egg-and-cheese mecca.  nothing beats spending pocket change on one of these heavenly sandwiches.
I have only had a breakfast sandwich from Bui's and frankly, I am not impressed. 

The sausage, egg and cheese is way better at Hemo's.
Hangover cure: sausage, egg, and cheese on a hoagie roll with ketchup and hot sauce.

The hot sauce is not just any hot sauce but Sriracha, the best hot sauce ever.  It guarantees to make everything taste better, minus ice-cream b/c that's just weird.

Either way, Bui's is awesome.  I also love how their rolls are warm and slightly toasted.  The people working there are super friendly.
The best breakfast sandwich in West Philly (and the best I've had in the city but I've not tried many outside of Univ. City).  

The rolls are the key.  Toasted, light, and fluffy. You tell Ms. Bui your order (probably bacon, egg, and cheese with salt, pepper, and ketchup) and it's up in about 2 minutes, even with a line.  Like the others have said, get Sriacha...I love it WITH ketchup as you get sweet and hot.  

I've been to Bui's so many times it's crazy.  It's a Penn staple and it's worth going to if you live in Univ. City.  

Their lunches aren't bad either.  It's about as good of a cheesesteak as you'll ever get off of a truck.
Deliverance from the vilest hangovers...now in truck form!

Seriously, as attested everywhere in recent Philly history by college students, Bui's is your miracle cure for your nightime indiscretions.  No matter what the issue is, bacon, egg and cheese with "salpeppaketcha" on a perfect pillowy white bun will help you regain your footing on the path to tranquility.

Take that first bite, bask in the sunshine and smile: bliss

PARTING THOUGHT: Bui's staff is great about making unusual sandwiches.  For example, I'm a fan of the cheesesteak with egg and siracha!
Ohhhh babyyyy Bui's breakfast sandwich is trucky food at its finest.  None of this $8 gourmet nonsense.  If I'm going to a food truck I want fast, good food but most importantly, I'm looking for something cheap!  There's a place in the world for the lobster roll truck... there's also a place in the world for Bui's! 

I'd be lying if I said I've never had a Bui's hangover special (ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, and cheese- comes with a gatorade, awesome) but typically I go for a #3 (tomato, mushroom, spinach, eggs, cheese).  The secret here is to order the Bui's sauce.  It's not really anything too special- I think Bui's sauce is a mix of hot sauce, ketchup, and mayo... given that I like all three on my eggs it's the perfect addition to my breakfast sandwich! 

The line is always long but thankfully you can text Mrs. Bui (856.630.7269) and she has it ready when you get to the front.  

Keep food trucks cheap! Support Bui's!!!
Cure for a hangover:

More alcohol 

and Bui's

I save this for Sunday mornings... and by mornings I mean early afternoon... but hell, it's morning to me!
I've only been here once. Got a couple breakfast sandwiches that were pretty good. The bread was fresh, but they add a spicy mayo sauce that I didn't know about and that completely ruined my egg & cheese sandwich :( other than that it was pretty standard breakfast.
For over 3 years, I've been a customer at this little foodtruck near the university's campus. As a family run business, they make their customers family as well-- getting regular customers, knowing orders, and hitting it out of the park every time. I haven't ordered in a while, so today I figured I'd see if I could get my favorite-- bacon, sausage, egg and cheese with salt pepper and bui's sauce! She stayed open an extra 5 minutes when I was a bit late and she was closing up, and had my sandwich waiting for me with a smile! 

The bread is soft and perfect with the breakfast meats and buis sauce, which gives it an almost spicy flavor with a a great texture that isnt dry at all! Ask and you shall receive- if you want extra bui's sauce to make it saucier, do it! If you want more meat, order extra. Customize it the way you want and you won't be disappointed. I've also tried the chicken salad, tuna salad, and cheesesteaks, and they are all so full of flavor and packed with toppings. It's worth the extra few bucks to get the bigger, real meat, real toppings sandwiches.
Whoa...the biggest food truck I've ever seen. You can probably fit a bed in there!

That probably reflects Mr. Bui's success. He (and others) serves things on a long French-like roll in large portions. I got something with egg, sausages, and mushrooms plus some Bui sauce. It was a short wait in the rain, and Mr. Bui had a yellow umbrella set up outside. Even at 10 30 AM, there were about 5-10 people at any one time on a Sunday morning at 10:30 AM.

This place is open even on the weekends, an affordable and convenient way to cure a hangover.
Excellent breakfast sandwich (get the Hangover Special...DO IT!!) and a decent Philly cheesesteak. Prices are very reasonable and Mrs. Bui (if that's her name...) is so sweet! There is this one creepy dude though who speaks in a really high voice who works there (Mr. Bui?). I actually never really noticed until a friend pointed this out to me. But I digress...this is probably the best breakfast sandwich truck on Penn's campus, so go!
A five star food truck? Is it possible? Is this the apocalypse?

Bui's wins on almost all criteria:
-Taste? Check, that Bui's sauce is a must for any sandwich
-Cost? Check, $4-6 dollars for anything. Cheaper if you're looking for a simple breakfast sandwich or cheeseburger.
-Convenience? Check, call or text your order in and you can enjoy your walk over to 38th Street in peace.
-Service? Check, Mr. and Mrs. Bui are super friendly and will always put a smile on your face.
-Hours? Check, open seven days a week for all three meals of the day. No other place can boast that kind of commitment.

Five criteria, five checks. This puts Bui's in lofty standing among food trucks.
Based off of the reviews here I was expecting something more substantial in terms of portion size. The sandwiches here are pretty large but it could do with a little more meat. I've ordered the hangover as well as a scrapple egg and cheese. The food itself is pretty delicious, no complaints about that.

They're friendly and they're fast in getting your orders out to you. I've ordered at the truck as well as phoned my order in. I recommend doing the latter if you're in a rush or if your office happens be a bit of a walk from the truck.
Penn's famous sandwich cart. I'm always a fan of supporting my fellow Viets, and when I found out there were making sandwiches of all things(and not Banh Mi), I didn't know what to expect. Ordered from the specials menu because that's where it's at, and got the Hangover Special w/Bui's Sauce and the Mr. Bui w/steak.

Hangover Special(3.5/5): I guess I really don't get these breakfast sandwiches for the most part. It is indeed a filling sandwich, and I was not unhappy with it. But given the ingredients(egg, cheese, bacon, ham, sausage), it's not terribly complicated to make and something I feel I could easily re-create at home if I bothered to.

Mr. Bui(3/5): Seemed like a beef teriyaki sandwich essentially. Nothing to write home about. Didn't hate it, didn't love it. 

I'd probably stick more to the breakfast based sandwiches though because they pair better with Bui's Sauce(gotta love mayo and sriracha). As a sidenote, I find it funny that the most popular sandwich carts in Philly are owned by Vietnamese people, but don't sell the most popular Vietnamese sandwiches(Banh Mi, where you at?). While none of the flavors are particularly impressive, the combination of Bui's sauce and breakfast classics means that Bui's will never let you down for a consistently tasty and filling sandwich.
The wheat bread wasn't impressive. I think most people avoid paying the extra 50c for the wheat bread, and go for the regular bread. Thats likely why the wheat bread was almost stale. 

I am not sure why the mixed veggie doesn't come with cheese in it. I have to say the spinach is sometimes a bit suspect. Its certainly not the freshest spinach out there, but it sometimes smells a bit stale. Oh and the mushrooms are out of a can. Which given my distrust of the spinach can't be a bad thing at all. They taste fine.

Overall, this is a foodtruck that sells its rolls for $3. Don't expect the world. Overall, I'm very happy with the 'regular' that I have here - double egg, cheese WITH mushrooms, bui sauce and hot sauce. I've had it on innumerable occasions now, and like the lady who makes it in a jiffy.
I love their Vegetarian sandwich (special #4). the bread is toasted to perfection and the combination of spinach and eggs is mouth-watering.  Overall it is very tasty.
A lot of people have called this great hangover food but my best friend introduced it to me as "Netflix food." She calls it the kind of guilty pleasure food you want to hold close to your chest and happily nibble on as you watch your favorite TV show and bum around on a weekend day (while procrastinating on homework, of course).

I tried the turkey bacon, egg, cheese sandwich and was pretty blown away by how satisfying and tasty it was. Make sure to eat it while it's still warm.  I was also so pleased to be able to choose turkey bacon (instead of regular bacon) as an option.Can't find that in most places! Additionally, the spicy Bui sauce definitely takes the sandwich to the next level. I expected it to be a red sauce but it turned out to be white -- interesting! Basically a spicy mayo. Can't wait to enjoy one of these when I visit Penn again!
This cart has been here for ages, and it's a shame that I hadn't checked it out until now! Super cheap breakfast and lunch food with a smile. Make sure you try the Bui sauce, it's some type of yummy spicy mayo. Not sure what kind of bread they use, but the other reviewer's comment about it being very fluffy and easy to fill up on, is spot on. Not a fan of the bread because there could be more meat on the sandwich. Can't really complain though cause it's so cheap and delicious!
Bui's is legit, I always get the breakfast sandwiches which are really cheap and the eggs are fresh. I get them with srichicha or bui sauce and sometimes with coffee or a juice. It is really cheap and when the line isn't long for lunch, i get a chicken sandwich gyro or chicken parm which are all on point. Mr. and Mrs. Bui are really nice people and wonderful cooks
Favorite breakfast sandwich truck in Philly. You can't go wrong with a sausage egg and cheese (I'm not a fan of bacon) or the veggie special. They can easily do egg whites and wheat rolls for the health conscious, and I always ask for extra ketchup instead of their mayo-based Bui's sauce. 

If you're in a rush, call in and place your order. No matter where you're coming from, it's generally ready by the time you get there. Or if you have a minute to enjoy the sunshine, you can chill in their lawn chairs and make some new friends. I would definitely call this place a University City staple.
I love everything about Bui's. Food, quality, and service! Yes, service. 

I tend to binge on Bui's depending on what part of the school year I'm in. If I'm busy and lazy, it's Bui's for brunch everyday. Nowhere else on campus (and dare I say...Philly?) will you be able to fill yourself up on such good food with so little money. A foot long sausage egg and cheese sub for $3.50 is absurd in the best way possible. When ordering, don't forget the Bui's sauce! I suspect it's just a mix of mayo and Sriracha, but it's delicious nonetheless.

While Mr. or Mrs. Bui's isn't going to serve you a sub on a silver platter, being able to text your order gives Bui's an A+ for service. Text your order 10-15 minutes in advance and they'll definitely have it for you!
You can't get much fuller for 4 dollars like you can at Bui's.

What to get- egg, cheese, and...
Steak if you're tryna do it up and be full (6 bucks)
bacon, sausage, or ham if youre happy with any meat (4 bucks)
mix veggie special if youre health conscious (4 bucks) ...but then maybe you shouldn't be eating here in the first place.

Also, get the Bui's sauce!!! Its definitely siracha plus some other ingredients that add to its somehow appealing glowing orange color.

Insider tip: this is the only food cart around UPenn where you can text in your order. Imagine this- sunday morning you wake up with a terrible headache from last night. All you can muster up is... steak, egg, and cheese with buis sauce and salt/pepper. Take a shower, walk over 15 mins later, and your sandwich is done for you. How heavenly does that sound?
"Salt peppa ketchup Bui sauce?" Always Bui sauce. Always always always.

Every breakfast sandwich from Bui's is on point on point on point. Super SUPER filling, delicious, cheap, and with quick service to boot! The long rolls are always so delicious and wonderfully chewy like some kind of magic French baguette.

Again, they're pretty fast, but even so, if you don't want to wait, you can definitely order ahead! :)

Last I checked, unlike Lyn's, Bui's is open 7 days a week. Lazy weekend mornings are made all the better with a Bui's breakfast sandwich.
Bui's is loved.  I like the egg and cheese sandwiches at different carts.  And this one is not significantly better than the rest.  But here is why they get everyone's loyalty: 
1. WEEKENDS - They are open on Saturday and Sunday. 
2. REMEMBER YOUR ORDER - I don't know how they do it, but they remember you.  I stopped going for several months and when I came back, they had it right. 
3. CONSISTENT FOOD - It is always good and they big roll is great when it is fresh. 

NOTE - For whatever reason, (hangovers?), they sell a lot of Gatorade with the egg and cheese.  Once I tried it, and it works.
So much has changed in our lives in the two years that we've been eating bacon egg and cheese with Bui Sauce. You quit Pilam. I quit Cobb. You quit smoking. I moved back home. You started a new job, then another new job, then another one. I did, too. You came into your own as an artist. I came out as trans to my friends and family. 

It's October and we wear turtlenecks almost exclusively now. (You joke that we killed a lot of turtles to get where we are.) Will we always wear turtlenecks? Probably not, you say. They'll come in and out of style. But they'll always be there for us when we need to come back to them.

Mr. Bui was gone for a while, but he's back now. Bacon egg and cheese with Bui Sauce is a dollar more expensive than it used to be. But it's alright. The sandwich is the same, and it's always there for us when we need to come back.
If you're in the mood for some delicious sandwiches in UCity, Bui's is the way to go! After having heard so many good things about this food truck, I finally gave it a try. Since then, I have continued to come back almost every week! Bui's has cheap, great sandwiches AND they are prepared in a super fast manner. My favorite is the hangover special, a very popular choice among other customers as well. It's filled with a sausage patty, bacon, eggs, and their special Bui's sauce. The Bui's sauce is most likely a combination of Siracha and mayo sauce, but the way they make it has a tasty kick to it! It's a delicious addition to all their sandwiches! 

The owners are Vietnamese and friendly! You also have the option to call ahead and make a phone order for pick up. I've also called and asked them what their hours are and it actually closes around 2:30-3p. Bui's is perfect for a breakfast or lunch sandwich!
I'm sad to not give it a 5-star review because I really do love this place, but I'm annoyed that my steak, egg, and cheese is $5.75 (their other sandwiches are significantly cheaper), and that the ends of my sandwich are always empty bites of bread. Also, I switched over from the bacon, egg, and cheese to the steak egg and cheese because they're skimpy on the bacon and it's not great quality bacon. Then again, the steak isn't supreme quality, but it's a lot more filling than the bacon. I also wasn't a fan of everyone's favorite Mrs. Bui. A combination of the fact that the chicken was of way lower quality than I wanted it to be...it was like thin little pieces of chicken like paper thin..It made me slightly uncomfortable. And I also wasn't a fan of the spicy mayo tasting stuff that is Bui's sauce. I know, I know, blasphemy.

Aside from that, I admit, I get a sandwich from this place probably about once a week, and it used to be much more often than that. They're pretty delicious. And so fast/conveniently-located on my walk to campus. Thanks Bui's, see ya soon!
A food truck, it has amazing breakfast rolls. Salt peppa ketcha always asked and a giant size - cheap, too, and always fast.  

If you ask for extra mushrooms, they will always put it on properly.  Bacon, ham, and sausage with cheese.. yum! Or extra mushroom & onion cheesesteak.

Eaten at them since 1998, and always go back when I'm close.
One of the best, if not THE best, food truck in West Philly. 

All of their sandwiches are really, really good - filling, tasty, and cheap. I'm a huge fan of the Mr. Bui and the Mrs. Bui, and get them with Bui's sauce - some sort of sriracha mayo thing, but it makes everything better. Everything else on their menu is great too, and you can get the staples like a BLT/egg sandwich/cheesesteak too. They also have Orangina sometimes as a beverage item, and who doesn't like that?

Mr & Mrs Bui are really friendly too, and once you've been there a few times, they start to remember your order. You can also call or text in your order for pick up which is really convenient if you're in a rush and want something quick to eat.
This place is amazing.  I am so happy they've been in business so long - I think I had my first Bui's in the 90's when my sister was at Penn, and can't wait until my next one.  

The sausage and bacon are equally good.  If you're in the mood to treat yourself at the expense of your health, get extra bacon.   Mmmmm.

Love it.  The egg sandwich standard.  "Bakea-egga-cheee!"
Awesome breakfast sandwich!  

My sandwich: I get egg, cheese, and turkey bacon (or sausage).  This comes on a toasted Amoroso roll. I always order Bui's special sauce, which adds a delicious siracha-based kick (i.e. this is a MUST to add).  I also say yes to salt, pepper, and ketchup.  A nice perk: Although I rarely do this, but you can also get all egg white if you want to make it healthier. 

Bui's serves hungry college students at Penn.  This popular food cart is known as the place to go when you're hung-over, and it really hits the spot when you want a hangover cure.  But it also makes a cheap, yummy, and filling breakfast when you're completely sober and are on a tight budget. When I lived near campus, I would come here several times a month for breakfast.  Not the healthiest breakfast on the planet, but absolutely delicious....

This is the best egg sandwich I've had in Philly!
Food trucks are an essential part of the West Philadelphia diet. They're everywhere: up and down Spruce Street, with a bunch on 38th and 40th. They're inexpensive, convenient, and many of them serve food that's surprisingly good. 

But Bui's Lunch Truck manages to stand out amidst all the rest. Maybe it's the charming Vietnamese family that runs the joint, or maybe it's those perfect egg & cheese sandwiches that they put together in no time, but people form long, long lines on the weekend to land one of Bui's famous concoctions. Penn kids will tell you it's the perfect hangover cure. 

If you make it there, definitely go with tradition: bacon, egg & cheese; sausage, egg & cheese; or just egg & cheese --- these sandwiches, on fresh Amoroso long rolls, are always your best bet. Ask for it with Sriracha-brand hot sauce, salt and pepper. Also, if you're watching your cholesterol, the Bui family can assemble a lovely egg white and tomato sandwich for you. Any of the above should run you about $1.50.
Good prices, lightning quick service, but the sandwich was only alright. Supposedly great for breakfast, not a great lunch place.
Fantastic breakfast sandwiches!  Egg and sausage on a soft and fresh hoagie roll cures everything.  Don't forget the salt, pepper, and ketchup, and the hot sauce if you are in the mood for something spicy.  It's delicious.
On Sunday mornings, sleepy college students recovering from the previous night's shenanigans wait in line at this food truck for the Hangover Special: sausage, ham, bacon, egg and cheese on a long roll from Amaroso's, plus a Gatorade. 

The crowd is mostly students. The breakfast sandwiches are standard combinations (steak, sausage, scrapple, bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, cheese). The lunch offerings rance from the pepperoni pizza steak to the Mr. Bui (steak or chicken with bell peppers and teriyaki sause) and Mrs. Bui (steak or chicken with spinach, tomato and the secret mayo-creamy Bui's sauce).

Your toppings are salt, pepper, ketchup, hot sauce (I believe Sriracha) and Bui's sauce.

This is the mecca for breakfast and lunch sandwiches.

Tip: When it's peak time, it's smart to call ahead with your order. Then you can quickly pay and scoop up your sandwich, beating the crowd.
I never got why Bui's is so apparently awesome. I must've missed the memo...

It's alright. I've gotten a couple of the specials, and their subs are typically made with a combination or ham, egg, cheese, and/or condiments, wrapped in foil and ready to eat. I get that it's cheap and convenient, but so are most of the food trunks along 38th or Spruce. 

Someone tell me what I missed, please!!!
It's one woman back there cooking and handling money so I understand that she's swamped and may take a little longer to get to you. The food is just so overpriced compared to the other food trucks. 4.50 for bacon egg and cheese is way too much. I don't know how they are still open when you can get the same at Hemo's for much less.
Best breakfast cart in University City. If you're a Penn student, you know Bui's as THE magical hangover cure on campus. If you aren't hungover, it's still a filling, cheap, delicious way to start your day. I usually get the veggie special with Bui sauce (some heavenly combo of mayo and sriracha) and I highly recommend you try it too!
Food (8.5/10) = After reading several yelp reviews, I decided to order "the Hangover" (Fried eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, and cheese, on a hoagie).  Added sriracha to it.  This is awesome breakfast food.  It's so simple, yet so phenomenal.  Really filling, and at a great price ($5).  If I lived or worked close to this place, I would make Bui's a weekly thing.  

Ambiance (?.?/10) = it's a food truck

Service (9.0/10) = very friendly, great smile

Overall = If you live or work around this food truck and haven't tried it yet,...what is wrong with you?  Go get yourself a "hangover"
I absolutely love breakfast sandwiches and I came to Bui's today for the first time...despite the fact that I've lived here for four years. Bui's is a great deal. I was a little worried the man taking my order might have missed something (Mr. Bui?), but everything turned out fine. No complaints. Be sure to be clear when ordering!  I'll definitely come back here for a quick, filling lunch or breakfast. You can basically order whatever is on the menu in any combination. Really  quick and easy!
Oh Dr. Bui and your instant hangover cure...I never actually ordered anything other than what's on their breakfast menu, so I can't tell you how good their cheesesteaks are. It doesn't matter though, since nobody goes to Bui's for anything other than their glorious breakfast sandwiches. Forget Steak Queen- Bui's has perfected the art of the fried egg sandwich. Back in the day, I rarely deviated from my staple of ham and egg with saltpeppa, and that's the way I liked it. At $2.25 a sandwich (cheese was an extra twenty-five cents, I believe), Bui's was (and is) by far the best bang for your buck you can get in University City. I'm pretty sure they singlehandedly raised my cholesterol by twenty points between my junior and senior years at Penn.
I think I ate Bui's many moons ago when visiting a friend at Penn during Spring Fling, but I, of course, don't remember. I paid Bui's another visit when I was in town.

$5.75 for a sandwich seemed kind of steep when I ordered The Hangover. Until I realized that the sandwich is pretty much the length of a samurai sword. You have the option to add salt/ketchup. Which I did. The girl behind me tried to substitute the sausage with turkey sausage (come on, be a man) and egg with egg white. They can do the egg white substitution but don't have turkey sausage.

Delicious ham, sausage, bacon, egg, and sauce. All sandwiched between perfectly toasted bread. I ate 3/4 of it while walking (with all the crumbs flying into my shirt and ketchup smeared all over my face) and ate the rest at 1:00am even though I wasn't remotely hungry.
These are legit breakfast sandwiches!!

I always order the sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich, and it's always consistent, delicious, and filling.  I would suggest trying the bui's sauce at least once, it compliments the sandwiches nicely.  Also, this is really cheap and usually pretty fast.  Overall one of the best food trucks on Penn's campus.
Dear Mrs. Bui (whoever you are),

Your namesake sandwich is the bomb. I'm pretty sure Bui sauce is just a warm version of the spicy mayo that comes with a standard spicy tuna roll, but there's something about putting it on chicken, bread and spinach that make it's extra awesome.
