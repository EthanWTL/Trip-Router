Very nice owner. HIs son works at Google in my neck of the California woods, and he is very proud of him. He has good souvenirs for reasonable prices. He shares the space with a tailor, who was also very helpful with recommending a place to get my luggage fixed. A very down-to-earth non-hipster friendly place if you need souvenirs in Old City or if you need a good tailor!
I agree owner was very nice and his shop was just what I was looking for!  T-shirt's, souvenirs etc. Even was open on Memorial Day!
Wide variety of items. worth checking out! Bought an eagles mug and a small liberty bell.
Really convenient location. I was looking for souvenir shot glasses and stopped in as I was walking around checking out old city Philadelphia. Shop owner was very friendly and polite. Prices were great!
Super friendly owner and fast service. Great selection of souvenirs to pick from. Appreciate the personal recommendations.
