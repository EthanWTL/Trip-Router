I got married at this site. The following is the complaint letter I mailed to the president, whom I have yet to hear from:


As residents of Philadelphia, Daniel and I were drawn to the beauty of the site which made it our first choice for our wedding. It is understandable that tensions are high during big events and that personalities may clash, but to say that the assigned site chaperone for our wedding was unprofessional is an understatement.

As part of our rental agreement, the director's room was to be my dressing room for the day. While I was dressed in a small robe getting my makeup done, the site chaperone barged into the room to obtain his belongings; he did not make himself known. Moments later, as I was in my undergarments, he stormed into the room a second time! Again, I demanded to know why he was there and why he did not knock on the door. When I explained to him that I was to have the room to myself, he completely ignored me and left.  In addition to his vulgar behavior towards me, I learned that he was demeaning to my hired staff, specifically my door person and owner of the cleaning crew, Denise and Carla respectively. 

-He commanded Denise stay at the door because his boss was afraid that terrorists would enter the building (this was extremely offensive as it was mentioned after a guest showed up in Muslim garb)
-He did not allow Denise to obtain food, beverages, or even a bathroom break
-He ate my catered food 
-He did not respond to inquiries over the walkie-talkie he provided Denise; he disappeared for most of the event as if he was "staying out of our hair" but he did not; he would just show up circulating as if he was a guest
-After repeated security deposit threats and over explaining what "clean and organized" meant, my husband was not comfortable leaving and stayed behind for 90% of clean up
--After my husband left, Dave consistently barked orders at Carla and her cleaning crew, threatening to keep my security deposit if they did not follow his orders.
He made Carla and her cleaning crew set up chairs for the following day's event
-He came onto Carla

While I understand that his connections to the site prevents him from being terminated, I would like a written apology from him for his utterly disgusting and grossly unprofessional behavior by October 5, 2016. I am mortified that a man other than my husband saw me half naked twice, and I am completely embarrassed at how he treated my staffers. No bride should ever have such an experience on a day that was meant to be joyous. I trust that you will respond in a timely fashion.
This weekend was actually the second time I've attended an event at the German Society on Spring Garden Street. The first was many moons ago, when we held our annual Roller Derby "Snow Brawl" celebration there. The second, was this past weekend, for the wedding of two of my favorite people. Now, I'm not sure just how much the venue was actually responsible for, and how much was caterers or outside influences, so I will just speak to the venue. On the first floor, is a gorgeous ballroom, complete with huge windows, a stage, and a bar. In the basement, there are multiple bathrooms and the kitchen area. There are a few upstairs floors that we had to bypass, but on the fourth floor.... ohhhhh the fourth floor.... lies the most spectacular library you will ever see. THIS is where my friends had their actual wedding ceremony, under the coolest book arch! It's the perfect location for a not too big, not too small event.
Rented venue for wedding.  Staff was not very helpful with recommendations for catering, etc. so expect to do that all on your own.  We found out the week of the wedding (Labor Day) that there was no air conditioning in the room.  Needless to say, conditions were pretty uncomfortable on a 90+ degree day in September.  Also, when we arrived to look at the room a few days before, there were no stairs at the entrance and the entire front of the building was under construction.  This was quite a surprise.  Temporary stairs were put up and we were allowed use of the library as an apology.  However, after the wedding I had to deal with losing half of the security deposit due to running over our scheduled rental time while caterers cleaned.  This led to a back and forth between caterer and venue about lack of cleaning supplies, etc. which was incredibly unpleasant.  Also, the 'chaperone' who was on site during the wedding was chatting with guests and made some off-color remarks.  He also would not allow us to leave leftover food in refrigerators overnight (despite clearing this with the venue beforehand) so we lost a lot of leftovers.  Terrible experience despite a beautiful room.  Would definitely not rent again.
