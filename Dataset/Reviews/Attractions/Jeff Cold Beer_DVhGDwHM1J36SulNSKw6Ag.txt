You will develop a rapport with the younger girl who works the counter on some early evenings; she will smile and not ask for your ID and bag your beer without asking. A stray brother may ask you for some change to get a Bud Ice; help a man get some bang for his buck. You will keep it casual with the other counter-people, watch their children through bullet-proof glass, maybe buy a candy bar, but wait to grab a blunt at the store down the block, because they are likely to be stale in here.

There's a menu on the wall, but it's mostly for decoration; an illusion, like Jeff himself. You will witness the brothers call any of the 3 men behind the counter Jeff on any given night. You might try it yourself, see how it feels, but the moment is fleeting, and the counter-man will purse his lips and slip a piece of cardboard in between your forties and slide them into your world.
Some of the best cold beer on 17th and Wharton is sold from Jeff Cold. I recommend their 22 ounce Bud Ice with a packet of Tylenol PM.
Friendly folks here. Great prices. TIP: don't take a plastic bag unless you really have to. Those bags are terrible for the environment and often find their way onto the streets, turning into south philly tumbleweeds.
The beer is cold and the Asian boner pills are FRESH. When I want a grape blunt and then drink a pounder with a straw, I go to Jeff Cold. Be nice to the people who work the counter! They deal with an extraordinary amount of shit from most of their patrons. Gotta go to JEFF.
When I get my cheap pounders of beer and pack of off brand cigarettes. Go visit JEFF
