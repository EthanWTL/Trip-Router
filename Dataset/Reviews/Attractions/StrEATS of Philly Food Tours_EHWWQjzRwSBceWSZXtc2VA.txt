My mother and I met Jackie yesterday for a food tour of Passyunk Ave. It was GREAT! I've lived in Philly for 4 years now, but have never really explored much of Passyunk Ave. other than for meeting friends for drinks and such. But Jackie made the area come alive! She had a story about nearly every store front, and being a South Philly native, she had many personal anecdotes from her own time growing up in the area. On top of all that, the food was amazing! We started out with some of the best fried chicken I've ever had from Redcrest, then strolled down the street to P'unk Burger. Awesome burgers and shoestring fries, followed perfectly by a Nutella milkshake. For desert, we were treated to baked goods from Vanilya which were the perfect amount of sweet! I can not recommend this tour enough, especially with the precautions Jackie takes to make sure you stay safe yet still have a good time. Thank you Jackie!
