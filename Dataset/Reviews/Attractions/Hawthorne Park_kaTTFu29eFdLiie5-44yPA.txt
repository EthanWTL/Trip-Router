I love this park. I remember when it was first installed, we were lucky to have it after the city tried to sell it out from under us when property values skyrocketed. The neighborhood had to fight to get it back, and obviously they won. It was designed buy University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Horticultural Society. The city and the neighbors have been wonderful taking care of it however we've had some problems with kids vandalizing over the years but that seemed to have dissipated lately. The only remaining problems we have are people running their dogs off the leash or on 25' foot leashes and it's tearing up the turf grass. And people using it as an athletic field which it is not. It's been a wonderful asset to the neighborhood. Let's all take care of it. John
