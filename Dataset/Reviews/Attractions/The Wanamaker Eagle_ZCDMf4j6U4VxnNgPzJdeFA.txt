This big giant bronze the eagle statue came from Germany over 100 years ago and it is still in the exact same spot where it has been. Now obviously it wasn't a Macy's there when they first put this but things have grown up and went around it so now it's in the shopping center is very popular you to meet me at Eagle this tradition store is lava day because when you're at the shopping center or you can say meet me at the eagle in there by Noske talking about so this is a cool thing to see
These days, this venue is a forlorn Macy's, but inside are many hints of a grand past, including this large, 2,500-pound  bronze eagle sculpture that came from the 1904 World's Fair in Saint Louis.

It rests in the center of the grand lobby and, to this day, remains a popular meeting point for folks here in Philly. It's so heavy, in fact, that the floor beneath it needed reinforcement.

A throwback to the days when department stores were true destinations.
Great place to visit to hear the organ music especially during the last weeks of October through the New Year. Never saw an organ this big before seeing the Wanamaker eagle. Enjoyable for all ages . Can be viewed from the street level to the upper floors. Truly a beauty to see and hear.
Okay so this is now Lord & Taylor, right? Oh no wait--its Macy's. Well that may be alright for some. But for me its still Wanamaker's. One of the great buildings of Philadelphia or any other city. Is the Wanamaker Eagle still there? Meet me at the Eagle! Astounding and lavish building interior. Tip: walk around the rear of the building--the Juniper Street side. Don't be afraid. There's  a remnant of the original facade! Overlooked by time. Just phenomenal.
