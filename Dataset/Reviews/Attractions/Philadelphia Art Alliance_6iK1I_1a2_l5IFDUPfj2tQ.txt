Interesting exhibits, WONDERFUL interior. 
I intend on renting out this space if I ever decide to get married.
(Already looked into it, and yes you can rent it)

Grand staircase, absolutely romantic cafe outside for lunch in the summer.  Food was decent, but the blueberry lemonade was notable.
This is a great organization run by really talented folks. Their mission is dedicated to the contemporary craft and design. They have two galleries downstairs which often have exhibitions from well known contemporary craft artists that are great. Juried shows can be seen here too, giving a wonderful variety to the space. Their programming is varied, presenting shows with Ars Nova, lectures from various people and kids days. 
Entry is only $5 and well worth it. The mansion in which the organization is housed is impressive, and right on the square. A must see for art loves in Philadelphia.
I attended the opening for the installation that is there until early March. This is a really amazing space. There were two floors open with art. The first floor is basically sitting rooms that were converted into small gallery spaces. The second floor has hallways and rooms that allow you to peruse the art in a logical circuit.

There was free wine, which is always nice. There appears to be something like a cafe in the rear, which is where the wine was.

 I had a really pleasant time exploring. Highly recommended for when you want to get your arts and culture on.
