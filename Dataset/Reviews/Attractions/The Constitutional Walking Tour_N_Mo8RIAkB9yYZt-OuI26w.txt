Loved it. Toured with Andrew and he was amazing.  He was very knowledgeable and open to every question. He took us to all the right places to see all the right things. The ONLY thing I would change (hence the 4 stars, albeit however trivial...) is stopping and going inside the places we could but didn't. Mainly, the Liberty Bell. I would gladly extend the tour 30 minutes to make more detailed and Emerson's stops. Overall, I would soooo do the tour again. It takes the guesswork out of it unlike a self-guided tour.
