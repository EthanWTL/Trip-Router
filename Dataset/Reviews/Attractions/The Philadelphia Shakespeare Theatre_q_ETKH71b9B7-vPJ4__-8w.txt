I saw a production of Romeo and Juliet here a way back when. and now that I remembered it's existence I'm definitely going to have to make it back. This theater is 90% dedicated to Shakespeare and his plays (The have Philly Fringe Fest plays when the Festival rolls in). They put on 3-4 of his finest works  every year, and they generally put a lot of effort into it. You can also get seats that are very close to the stage, and they have Student Discount if I remember correctly.
I came here to see Othello last weekend and I loved it!  The performance was amazing (I hadn't seen anything Shakespeare in years so it was wonderful), and sitting in the front row I felt so CLOSE to the action!  The stage was up a few flights of stairs and since I'm wearing a aircast boot, it took some effort to get up and down the stairs.  One of the staffers was so kind and escorted me, which was really sweet of her.  This is the type of place I love to support and I will definitely have to look into seeing Much Ado About Nothing!
