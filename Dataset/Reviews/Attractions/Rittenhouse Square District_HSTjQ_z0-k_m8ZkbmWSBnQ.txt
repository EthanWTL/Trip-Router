Honestly had an amazing time here for the weekend stay. Alittle pricey but the staff and quality was up to par. Our room was constantly cleaned throughout the day, ice was restocked and I love the fact the hotel was walking distance to many places. Downstairs they have a nice bar and a beautiful outdoor patio area that we used to relax and talk- wasn't loud at all. I'd def stay here again.
Rittenhouse Square is a lively park in one of the nicer areas of Philly.  It has a great community vibe despite getting touristy on the weekends.  When we were there on a Sunday afternoon, there were many events and performances going on inside the park and an art exhibit on the sidewalk outside of the park's perimeters.  Fun place to sit on the benches and people watch!
