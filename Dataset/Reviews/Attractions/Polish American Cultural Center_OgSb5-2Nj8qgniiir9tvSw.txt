Although this might not be for everyone, the gift shop inside the Polish American Cultural Center offers a small but decent selection of gifts for those with Polish Heritage. I was able to buy a Names Day card (which is the birthday of your Saint's name) for someone for just $1. It was written in Polish and I really had no idea what it said, but it's the only place I know of in the city that you can find Polish-themed items.
A strange little place. You can get a Polish Christmas card in here or a Christmas ornament from Poland or a jar of gooseberry jam.  I wondered what on earth gooseberry jam tastes like so we got some.. it's similar to pear. A lot of photos of Pope John Paul II. It seems like a fledgling museum that's trying but needs more money to do it up right.
It is really worth visiting to see some of the community events they organize and host. They're always such nice people and going is a pleasure.
This is a very small museum. I found the info about the Polish involvement during world war 2 to be very interesting and informative. You can do the entire exhibit in 10 minutes.
My son who is 11 is obsessed with his culture. In my heart I want to give it maybe a 2 star. But  it  was free to get in and he somewhat enjoyed it. It took us about 10 minutes to walk around the room. 15 if you stop and read everything. I would have loved it to be bigger and maybe offer a little more. They sold polish trinkets and a few sweets T-tshirts and *polish water ice* If you are sight seeing in the area why not . But definitely not worth a long  drive.
