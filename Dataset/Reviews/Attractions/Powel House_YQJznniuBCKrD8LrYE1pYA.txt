I am shocked this historical building only has 1 yelp review. My girlfriends brother was married here over the weekend just a fantastic set up. The garden is beautiful, the house well kept and the guide even gave us a full tour before the wedding started. I love history and to be able to tour a home of a wealthy colonial really put a lot of things in perspective for that time. The house itself is gorgeous, some work has been done but for the most part it's almost all the same as in the 1700s. Just a great piece of history that I'm glad the city of Philly held onto!!!
I had never heard of the Powel House before -- until I was hustled off off the street by a charming story teller. Story teller? Yes. For the summer they have a young actress who will give you a dramatic dialogue based on the people who lived in the house. In fact, they have story tellers at 18 different historical sites, not just this one. And it's just three minutes, so enough to learn something and either continue on your way or maybe go inside or come back another day. 

The story is enthusiastic, choreographed, and well acted. She's perfect at it.
