Brought my kids here on Saturday evening.  It was really nice, clean and well-maintained.  There is a lot of interesting playground equipment.  The kids had a good time.

I wasn't sure if people would give me the hairy eyeball for being white.  Nope, everyone we met was really nice.  I love you, West Philadelphia.

Addendum 2009-08-25: Monica S. asks about the playground equipment.  One example is that there is a pair of little spaceships for climbing on and in.  One of the spaceships has a fancy control panel.  A nearby climbing fort structure has an alien on it.  My wife wonders if someone is punning 51st Street as  Area 51.

The larger climbing structure has a sort of trolley on an overhead rail.  You can hang from the trolley and ride it to the other end of the rail without touching the ground.
One of Philadelphia's hidden gems, Malcolm X Park (formerly known as Black Oak Park) is located between 51st & 52nd streets and Pine and Larchwood streets.  Filled with towering oak trees, it's the perfect spot to come and relax, and is much more quaint than Clark Park.  The park is well-maintained, and definitely reflects the positive changes that are happening in the neighborhood.  Over the course of the next few years, this will likely be the next "in" neighborhood in West Philadelphia.
Great park and definitely under-rated. Clark Park gets all the credit but this neighborhood gem has come a long way back to its glory days. Developers are putting up luxury apartments with park views and new businesses are popping up. Great area to grow with.
Super nice park with little kid playgrounds, plenty of grass and tree-canopy. The park is as big as Rittenhouse, but located in this quiet residential neighborhood at the edge of the Cedar Park neighborhood and right along the 52nd St corridor. This is a great east meets west Philly local and a solid place to mingle with neighbors.
