Wings are small, but priced accordingly. The wing sauce is not too hot and delicious. Monday and Tuesday nights offer $2 pizzas with whatever toppings you like. Wednesday is pasta night. It might be veal or chicken parm with pasta. $5. Thursday through Saturday nights offer ten cent wings. Friday night offers a free buffet. Breakfast sandwiches are awesome. All the food is very good. Not much for ambiance. All the bartenders and patrons are very nice.
Ah yes Lenegan's another old hangout from my Mayfair days. During football season back in the Buddy Ryan era my friends and I would do the Mayfair bar tour some Sundays and Lenegan's was the first bar we would start at. Then proceed down Frankford Ave with a detour on Brighton St to hit McNally's ,then Reale's,Jamm's, Beef N Beer, Tom's Pub, Longshore Tavern, and so on working our way back to Rauchut's for the Sunday night game and close down the bar.We were pretty hammered by the time the night was over. Lenegan's is a great place to hang although I haven't been there in awhile. I lived on the Main Line for the past 20 years and I like it very much and there are some cool places here but I really do miss Mayfair at times. Sometimes I'm tempted to move back but my wife is from the Main Line and has always been set in her ways out here. Oh well you can take the guy out of Mayfair but you can't take Mayfair out of the guy.
Ellen is great on Wednesday's for happy hour from 4-6!  Very personable and attentive!
The wings are great, they have 10 cent night. GREAT VALUE. The bar has three pool tables. They should have a bouncer. Try the wings and pizza.
