I have been staying here for years and the ONLY issue I have had so far is from the front desk staff.  I see there are some nice ones but for some reason I never seem to get them.  The lady at the desk when I checked in on Saturday seemed like she wanted to be ANYWHERE but where she was.  And I understand how that can feel, but when you're in the service industry you have to just keep that stuff inside and put on your happy or at least courteous face.  Everytime I said please or thank you or smiled she literally scowled at me.  And I was standing next to a guy who had the nicest woman at check in and they were laughing and he asked for a room with a river view and she was happy to help him.  Then I turned to my chick and said "Have any more views for me?" And she said "No" 
LOL it was funny.  
Anyway the rooms are clean and spacious.  They have cute touches of Philly in their artwork.  There is a keurig in there with coffee pods and a mini fridge available.  The bathroom has a standard tub/shower combo and the toilet is situated between the tub and the sink which I hate cause it feels a little cramped, but for one night I don't care.  The toiletries provided are JR Watkins so its good stuff.  Breakfast is included with your stay and its pretty decent.  There is oatmeal, cold cereals, yogurts and fruit, baked goods, pancakes, meats, eggs, bagels, and plenty to drink.  You can also request almond milk and lactose free milk if you need it.  The coffee is meh but for "free" how can you complain.  Its a good way to fill your belly before you head out.  
The location is walking distance to Penn's landing and there's plenty to do right around the property.  Uber and Lyft know right where to grab you here if you are heading elsewhere.
Stayed here to take the kids to see some of the historical sites in Old City and the Seaport Museum at Penn's Landing. We arrived around 10 AM and planned to just park and head into the city, but when I went in to confirm with the front desk that it was okay to leave my vehicle prior to check-in, they informed me that they had rooms available, gave me the keys and allowed us into our room. Very impressed with that, and it was a precursor of a very nice stay. This is a pretty good property, as long as you come in with your expectations appropriately set.

 ***PROS*** -Very good location! There's very little in the immediate vicinity (although Cherry St. Pier is right across the street and D&B's is right down the road), but it's an easy 15-20 minute walk or a $10 Uber to Old City or a 10 minute to Penn's Landing. -Views! Be sure to pony up the few extra $$$s for a Riverview room. It's worth it! -Room condition. Our room was exactly what we expect from a HIE: clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Nothing fancy, but it delivers what it promises!

 ***CONS*** -It can get LOUD here. Half the rooms face I-95, the river view rooms face Columbus Boulevard. Staying on a Friday night, there were quite a few street races and ATVs blasting down the Boulevard off and on from about 10 PM all the way to 2-3 AM. Even on the 6th floor and with the sound machine that we travel with on, we were woken up several times. -Parking. At $30 a night, it's pricey for open lot parking. You DO get unlimited in-and-out privileges, but still. -Breakfast Buffet safety. It was nice to see a nearly fully stocked breakfast buffet again, but there were very little mitigation measures in place, and no one present to correct the guests who ignored what Was expected (several guests walking back up to the buffet maskless, touching items then putting them back, etc.). 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay here. It did exactly what we hoped it would do as a home base for some Old City sightseeing for a family. The noise was a significant issue, but there's very little that management can do about that. Bring a sound machine, some ear plugs and plenty of hand sanitizer (and maybe your own breakfast!), and I think you'll be pleased with your choice.
Stayed for one night and in the whirlpool room. The room is a decent size perfect for a mini couple's getaway. The room including the whirlpool was clean. The whirlpool was a triangle shape, good size for us. I was impressive by how friendly the staff was, they said good morning etc. The free breakfast was good for what it was, not the best food ever but definitely much better than other free breakfasts, there's hot food including pancakes, sausages, eggs, biscuits, and your standard yogurts and cereal. Parking was $30 which is pretty pricey, but you have to pay since there's not much free parking surrounding the hotel. Overall, had a pleasant stay and would definitely recommend if prices aren't unreasonable.
The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are clean, breakfast in the morning was convenient. When I checked in, I was waiting at the desk for almost a minute while Sheday (not sure of the spelling) finished her text message or facebook post on her phone and greeted me as I was interrupting her. I was issued my room and I had to drag my laptop, my luggage and my coat and purse to the 10th floor only to get there and my key didn't work. I came down of course and requested another room away from the ice maker and elevator door. I was then given a room on a floor full of kids which was loud, noisy, and sounded like they were wrestling. Oh and I must mention that this room was also by the elevator. The same room, different floor. I called the front desk and asked for another room due to the noise. The manager Nick at the time told me to stay in my room and he would bring me the key. Of course he took his time coming. When he arrived I asked him what took so long. He then said, "I thought I was doing YOU a favor by bringing you a key but obviously you don't appreciate it and it appears we just cant make you happy here so you need to gather your things and stay somewhere else". He continued to tell me he will refund my money to my room because this would be the third time he would move me and he tells me "you are just that type will never be happy and satisfied so you need to go somewhere else where you would be happy". Mind you, I was calm and maintained my professionalism. He continued to bully me and threaten to evict me. I told him if I am paying for a room it is my right to request a room change if that room does not meet my expectations and in this case it was noise from the ice maker and elevator, then the noise from the floor full of kids. He continued to persist to refund my money and "make arrangements for me to go somewhere else". I was appalled by him treating me this way. I was traveling all day and there on business so I did not want to leave, I just wanted to be comfortable. He was condescending and continued to talk to me disrespectful and overall I felt bullied. I told him I refuse to go back and forth with him and I will escalate this to his manager and I asked who he reports to. He told me "I'm not giving you that information, you have to look it up yourself". He then told me "are you going to take this room or do I need to call you a cab and help you with your bags and send you somewhere else?" I am not one for conflict so I told him I will take the room. Of course the room was the SAME location again just a different floor near the ice maker, high traffic and the elevator. In requesting a different room I was told there weren't any more of my type of room available and I agreed to take a downgraded room and that I just wanted to be away from the noise of the kids. I never in my LIFE felt so disrespected, bullied, and humiliated while in a vulnerable position because I needed to stay in this hotel. It was obvious he only agreed to bring my key to me to avoid being on the cameras that were at the front desk. I gave this hotel 2 stars because the rooms are actually decent, and when I escalated the situation in the morning the director of sales and the on duty manager Kelly were very accommodating and took the time to listen to me and apologized on Nick's behalf and that made up for how I was backed into a corner by Nick. If a friendly staff is what is important to you in a hotel, I would HIGHLY suggest you not stay here while NICK WILLIAMSOM is still employed here. If he is, If you are not satisfied with your room, you will be made to feel like a burden and an inconvenience by him if you request to change it. And if you request to change it again due to loud noise of other guests (in which him as a manager should have controlled), you will be bullied and humiliated. This guy has no business working in a leadership role in the hospitality industry. 3 times I requested a room away from the elevator and ice maker and EACH time I was moved to a the same rooms ending in "08" next to the elevator and ice maker and told there were no other rooms available in which after my due diligence I found out was a lie. SMH.. The GM and Director of Sales did make efforts to accommodate me by giving me 2 nights stay via my reward points but I would never use them here.
Stayed here after a wedding over the weekend and really wished I could give it higher than 3 stars, but cannot for the following reasons. We were charged 172.00 for a room with one bed, when it was supposed to have two. Since they gave our room away, security gave us one cot and when we opened it, realized they did not give us sheets. We called back down for sheets that we eventually got, but then realized we were not given our gift bags from the bride and groom. We were told they would financially compensate us for giving us the wrong room, but never did. Parking was $60 when the sign up front said between 20 and 30. I feel like this hotel was just a huge scam and when traveling from across the state and looking forward to being hosted, instead we left feeling ripped off. Also, the wifi was not working properly in our room. At least the rooms were clean and the front desk staff were friendly. Still, I probably wouldn't return to this location.
My family and I have stayed at this Holiday Inn Express many times even though we live in Philadelphia. I stayed here this past week and I don't think I'll be returning, sadly. I got into my room that was very accommodating, as usual. Upon closer examination, however, I found a pubic hair (yes, really, a pubic hair) in the tub and the ice bucket that was supplied had a little yellow (?) crud on the inside. During the night my neighbor was very loud, and kept slamming their door hard throughout the night. I called the front desk three times to resolve the issue, and the young lady that answered said she would send security up to take care it. Well, it was never resolved. The slamming of the front door continued until 3:30 am, so needless to say, I hardly got any sleep that night. Now I don't blame the hotel for a rude person slamming their door because people should know manners, but I had to call three times. Three times? I have to also add that even after the third complaint to the front desk that the person next door to me continued to slam their door and just be loud and obnoxious. Really?

The icing on my horrible stay was the morning I left. Both elevators were out of service so I had to take the stairs down to the lobby. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if I were on the 2nd or 3rd floor but I was on one of the upper levels of the hotel. The front desk didn't seem to really care that the elevators were out or that it was an inconvenience. As I said before, I don't think I'll be returning again.
Directions: If you're on Penn's Landing, walk down the ramp until it curves. Before it curves, take the staircase down on your left. Cross the 6-lane street immediately. Turn right on the sidewalk, walk for a couple minutes, and you'll see it right in front of you on your left.

This was a pleasant, non-smoking hotel. When I got to my floor, I smelled smoke. I called the front desk, and they came to investigate. Soon after, I couldn't smell smoke anymore.

The complimentary breakfast is delicious!!

They have a free shuttle at the hotel that'll take you anywhere within a mile of the hotel (and pick you up again when you call), so we definitely used that to go places. It adds value to what you paid for your room since you don't have to pay for taxis. There are 13 seats (besides the driver) in the shuttle. It comes to the front of the hotel every time it's  done dropping people off (every 20-25 minutes or so).

I have nothing bad to say about this place.
If you stay here, make sure your room is not on the left side of the hotel! It faces I-95 and you will be able to hear the highway. It sounds like a raceway all times of the day and night. I could not sleep because of the noise. I want everyone to have a better experience than I did, so please note this when booking your reservation.
Stopping in Philadelphia was a last minute decision for our tour of east coast cities. We're really happy with our decision to stay here. The hotel was very busy and in a great location. Once we settled into our hotel we decided to use the hotel courtesy ride.

The courtesy van will drop off and pick up within a one mile radius of the hotel. We had the driver drop us at the Reading Terminal Market. Along the way he explained the points of interest to navigate our way back to the hotel.

The continental breakfast was more than we expected as well. Something for everyone.

I recommend giving this place a try. We enjoyed all the amenities and the great location at an affordable price. Wish we stayed another night.
The Holiday Inn Express was fine. We were in town for a concert at the Fillmore and the Holiday Inn Express seemed like one of the closer hotels. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but location.

One of the great added values of staying here was access to the hotel's shuttle. You can wait in front of the hotel and the van will take you anywhere within a mile free of charge. Once you take the shuttle somewhere, the driver gives you a card with his number on it and you can call for a ride back when you're ready (the shuttle cannot be scheduled). Our driver (on the evening of 3/23/19) was absolutely wonderful and accommodating.

One of the other values of this hotel was the included breakfast. It's standard hotel breakfast, but sometimes being able to eat some eggs in the morning makes all of the difference.

The parking charge was $30, which isn't unreasonable, and included in/out privileges. The parking was arranged with the hotel front desk and added to our bill. You need to keep a room key to unlock the gate to leave...and neither of our room keys worked to let us out. Thankfully there was an attendant, who was also unable to get our room keys to work, and  helped out.

The rooms are not at all quiet, so be prepared with ear plugs. I wasn't and we were given a room directly across from the elevator...so we had drunk people screaming all night in the halls.

I really wavered between 3 and 4 stars, but went up to 4 because the shuttle driver was so awesome.
I stayed here recently for one night with my parents through Hotels.com. The rate had actually gone down since we booked and Hotels.com refunded the difference. I had stayed here once before (March 2012) with a friend so knew what to expect. The room and common areas were very clean. Service was excellent. The complimentary breakfast was varied and generous, although I didn't partake of it, personally. Although the hotel's location is a bit inconvenient, the free shuttle service (until 10pm) was a plus. They will drop guests off as far west as Broad Street. The fitness center is tiny (two treadmills and a stationary bike) and could use a renovation. Neither treadmill worked well and there were no clean towels but it's not a gym so....  Parking is a bit pricey ($25) for in/out privileges but that is to be expected in the city. Also, we had a room facing the I-95 and, as other reviewers have noted, it is very loud. Ask for a room facing the river. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.
Hotel manager and staff was very rude. They refused to charge my parking to a room even though I had authorization and proof of authorization. Multiple attempts made to have the situation resolved. I use holiday inn express all the time. Steer clear of this holiday inn.
Busiest lobby I've ever been in.  Seriously, I've never seen so many people just hang out in a lobby.  I was a bit confused, also, the temperature in the rooms/hotel was way higher than expected.  Breaking down everything would go as follows:

Staff: 4 stars, friendly, and courteous
Basic hotel offerings: 0.5 star, food was meh (though free at breakfast), coffee is better skipped, parking is paid, one elevator worked in a 10 story building, not cool, and the stairs were locked on the first floor so you couldn't use them. Bathroom soaps were not very effective bring your own.
Room comfort: 2 star: AC system was VERY loud (yet necessary to deal with the fore mentioned heat), bed was comfy though
Room view: 5 stars, we were on the 10th floor and had a great view of the Ben Franklin bridge.  

Overall, not sure I'd go back, but the price was hard to beat.
I usually have nothing but nice things to say about this location, especially. It used to be my favorite hotel down by Penns Landing... until this weekend. Just felt reeeeeaaalllyyyy racially profiled at Holiday Inn check in on Saturday. I didn't see anyone else's process take as long, nor did the clerk go in the back to make copies of anyone else's ID's... very interesting. I've stayed here many times and usually it's smooth sailing. But I see they gave some #privileged lady a job at the front desk. How unfortunate... The rest of the night I felt like we didn't belong so we stayed out most of the evening and only slept there. We left fairly early the next day. I'm happy she wasn't there when we checked out. I hate that someone could make me feel so small in my own skin. Smh shame on you for that! It's 2019, not every young black couple is up to no good. We work hard and just wanted one night away, like everyone else!!!!
Stayed here for 2 nights (3/25 and 3/26).  Due to tournaments in town the hotel was full of teens, either HS or College age.  They were all respectful and seemed organized.   However, people arguing in the hall way and what I assume to be coaches filling up coolers with ice at 3 am was a bit much.  Mentioned the excess noise to the front desk but my complaints/comments were not really acknowledged.  The location is good and we felt safe walking.  Rooms were ok, although only 2 wash cloths which seemed odd, breakfast was good but the parking fees seemed a bit high.
Great value for your money. It's right in the middle of all the action as well. I thought being in the old city meant we were too far from the major sites.  

This hotel is beautifully renovated.  They even have a courtesy shuttle that will drive you anywhere within a 2 mile radius and pick you up as well. Just tip the driver a few bucks. 

The hotel has a beautiful view of the Ben Franklin Bridge. So definitely ask for a room with a river view.  

The staff here is so friendly. They will accommodate you in any way they can and they actually know their stuff.

The rooms are spotless. The beds are quality. They're double sheeted... Just the way I like them. 

We were able to easily see all the sites from this hotel. We were able to zip down to the Phillies game. So many hip restaurants in walking distance of this hotel as well.  

A decent walk to go to independence hall and Liberty Bell area.

They do have a complementary breakfast which has tons of items. I have to say the folded over egg omelette thing you with cheese inside is a little hard to eat. It's just kind of gross. But the other selections they have are varied and good

We were thoroughly glad we stayed here.
Booked this hotel for 2 nights. Vacationing with friend. Like everything about this place - location -close to the highway, on the bank of the river, next door to the restaurant, more accross the street. Hotel have courtesy shuttle running from 8 am to 9:30 pm, dropping you off and picking up from locations in historical part of town. We called and van was there within 10 minutes. Hotel staff very pleasant. Next time definitely check with them first.
For a check out time of 11am our room still wasn't ready at 4pm when we got there. The parking is $25 a night so the hotel price is really not as appealing as it looks. Had to call house keeping because there where no pillow cases on the pillows. Had suprise $25 dollar a night damage deposits that no one informed us about, which we have still yet to receive back. View of the bridge was nice, and the beds were comfortable. All in all there's tons of better places to stay in Philly.
My stay at the Holiday Inn this past weekend was definitely A-OK.  The location is a little difficult because it's located on the highway and transportation is necessary in order to get to downtown Philly.  There is a casino, and two restaurant/bars within walking distance however and the hotel also offers a free shuttle bus that will take you to the subway which was great.  The price is right for the accommodations.  The hotel was spacious and very clean.  You must get a bridge side view because the scene is BREATHTAKING.  I mean really beautiful with the water and the bridge, especially as the sun is setting at night.  One complaint about the room was that they didn't give enough towels and there was only one roll of toilet paper supplied, BUT, I called down to the front desk and requested more and within minutes I had more!  

The supervisors at the front desk were SO accommodating and friendly.  They were young and lively and just really helpful.  They called cabs for my friends and me and gave great advice on restaurants, bars and late night food deliveries!  The lobby area was always busy but there were plenty of seats to hang out.  Parking is $25 PER NIGHT!  Yikes.  You have no choice if you are bringing a car, either you pay to park or you don't park at all.  There is no street parking.  Reason why I am only giving this place three stars and not four is because of the continental breakfast.  Woof.  Pretty bad.  The hours are 6:30 to 9:30, and let me say that 9:30 doesn't really work for us girls who are out drinking til 3 am.  I luckily caught the last few minutes of breakfast on our last morning and couldn't find one decent thing to eat.  It didn't seem like they do a very good job of restocking throughout breakfast because they were out of everything.  They had some sort of grits and biscuits (didn't look appetizing in the least bit) there was some cereal that tasted stale, some bagels and that was it.  Even the coffee was bad.  

Also, the vending machine had the weirdest choices I have ever seen in my life.  They didn't have normal items like pretzels or granola bars.  They had microwavable wings, mac and cheese, pork belly sandwiches.  It skeeved me out a bit I won't lie.
BEWARE! Parking - $25 per day. Refrigerator - $10 per day. The wifi is inconsistent. I understand that housekeeping need to their job, but when they're YELLING, "Housekeeping!" and letting doors slam starting at 9am, that's not really cool for anybody that may decide they want to sleep in.

However,  you can't beat the location, as everything is within 10 minutes walking distance - Delaware River, Penn's Landing, GREAT restaurants, old city, great book & music stores. The staff are all delightful and the continental breakfast is pretty standard, in other words, you can start your day decently. Clean and maintained.
Overall, experience was not bad but the location was way out of the way for many attractions. However, my BF and I DID choose to stay here because a lot of the attractions we wanted to go to were in this area. 

Our room was clean and they provided enough towels and what not. However, the tissue box looks like a dog rummaged through it and the owner placed them back in, not sure if they wanted to make it look fancy/flarey but yeah... Also, they did not throw a comforter on one of the beds. Luckily my BF is usually warm even with AC. 

The good thing about this Holiday Inn was the free shuttle van! The drivers were nice and quick to get to places. Note, they are willing to go 2 miles to and from the hotel so don't go all the way to Pats and Geno's and expect a ride home to the hotel. My BF and I are not fit people so this was a nice accommodation. 

One of the attractions we wanted to visit for this trip was Adventure Aquarium over at Camden, NJ. The ferry was close by so that was a plus! Other than that, take the shuttle to Chinatown or other popular Philly areas.

Forgot to add, they have complimentary breakfast from 6AM to 10AM. There's yogurt, Chobani Greek Yogurt, milk, cereal, eggs with cheese folded inside, Turkey and regular sausage as well as a pancake machine. The pancake machine takes awhile and on weekends, the dining area is PACKED. Would suggest not to wait for the pancake maker. Coffee, juices and tea are also provided.
I stayed here for two days sade is a nice young lady checked me in early when i arrived the ladies that fix and clean the tables are humble. The breakfast wasnt good powdered eggs old bagels i never been to a holiday inn that serves such nasty breakfast. The hallways are very small the guy that does the laundry was standobg in front of my door in the morning laughing talking loud i had to open the door to let him know that was unacceptable the wAlls  are cheap and thin no fridge no microwave, rooms are too small not that many channles most of them were sports channels. I went downstairs at 7:43am to tell them that i needed the shuttle for 9:15 am yvonne and lauren said that will be fine i came downstairs by 9:08am she shuttle was pulling away crowded and left she tells mr you cant put your luggage in there is no room i said what happened why did the shuttle just leavr me i was here early she said oh well take a cAb then or sit here snd wait for him to come back. Wow i feel that thats not the way you treat a guest stay at the hyatt or sheraton society hill its much better good service
So far they are at three stars! Let's see how this weekend goes. I can always update it with great service.
Overall, a clean, quiet hotel at a convenient location. At first I was skeptical that this would be a shoddy hotel, but it ended up being one of the nicer Holiday Inn's I've been to. First off, we payed around 200 a night which is quite expensive but expected due to the overall location. I was most impressed by the complimentary breakfast (omelet, sausage, boiled eggs, pancakes, bagels, everything). They always had free coffee and hot chocolate in the lounge and occasionally had free pretzels/cookies in the lounge; it's the small things that I appreciate from these hotels. Their bathrooms were always clean in the lobby as well as the seating area. As far as the bedrooms, our room had a nice spacious hallway with a well furnished bathroom and bed. Parking is 30 dollars extra per night but that's also expected in Philadelphia. Overall, I would come back again whenever I'm in the area and would recommend to others.
Entirely based off the incompetence of their front desk staff.

Rooms weren't ready at 4pm -- time for check in. Ready by 4:45pm.
They were absolutely rude when it came to figuring out the mess that was caused by the block of rooms I had booked. I had people call in to claim a room and transfer that room from my credit card to their and have the room under their names.
That didn't happen.

A few hours later I come downstairs to resolve an issue with keys and instantly the male became accusatory and said it was my friend's fault that the issue was present. EVEN if it was indeed a customer error, it is rude and unprofessional to blame the customer about the issue. I came down simply to ask to resolve the issue which all it took was to reactivate my card. THAT'S ALL I wanted done.

I didn't need his attitude and rudeness to ruin the weekend's experience.

They are probably the WORST front desk I've EVER had the displeasure to meet.
1 Blonde guy and 2 blonde girls. Please Holiday Inn Express...fire them and start over.
This hotel was one of the lower-priced options in Philadelphia and it looked like it was within walking distance to everything so we booked right away.  The rooms are clean and spacious, but there isn't a wow factor.  It's more of a place where you go to crash before you hit the town for the night or come back just to sleep.  

The hotel is on the water and the view can be quite pretty on a nice day (we were actually surprised with some impromptu fireworks).  Dave and Buster's is one of the closer attractions if you're into games.  A hotel shuttle will take you to/from a 2-mile perimeter.  Other than that, you will need a car to move around and get places.  Parking was $25.  This isn't a bad price as it allows you to get in and out.
Hotel was nice and rooms were good but I didn't have any hot water - luke warm at best. I tried showering at 3 different times over the course of my stay but still had the same results...
A clean quiet stay 
We just checked out after four nights in this hotel and my husband and I were pleased with our stay.  The room and lobby were very clean and comfortably appointed.  The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets (I hate scratchy sheets in hotels).  The free breakfast was fine with a lot of choices.  I really appreciated the egg white omelets. The front desk was very helpful. We had a few hiccups with our stay and they smoothed everything over very professionally. 
I would recommend a room on a high floor facing the river.  Not only is the view beautiful but it was much quieter then a room overlooking the freeway on the other side of the hotel.  I'm a very light sleeper and I had no problem with our room.  
The location of the hotel was fine for us as we were visiting family who live nearby but just be aware that this hotel is a mile from the tourist spots in phili.  About a $6 uber ride so not too bad and it's also a pleasant walk. There's a cute restaurant next door and many restaurants in old city about a five to ten min walk away.  

We recommend this hotel.
I made a mistake. I accidentally booked the wrong night. My fault...

But when I called to change the date I was told that it would be an extra $200 (more than the original price of the room) to change it by one day. When I expressed my displeasure, I wasn't offered a solution. I wasn't handed off to a manager. Even after I stated that I was so displeased I would never be booking with them in the future, nothing changed. 

As a member of the hospitality industry myself, I am appalled. Instead of accommodating me and inspiring my loyalty in the future, even when they might not have been the cheapest option, they have lost me as a customer and inspired me to post a negative review here in hopes of dissuading others from booking with them in the future. Bad move Holiday Inn Express. I hope it was worth it.
I booked a room and went to check in yesterday earlier than the normal check in time and was told that I can preregister and when a room is available they will call me.  I was guaranteed a room by 4:00 pm.  At 4:45 still no call so we walked back to the hotel and when we walked in the lobby was jam packed!  I was told I still didn't have a room since one wasn't ready.  Now if check out is at 11:00 and it's now 5:00 how can there not be a room available for a paying customer?!  The whole reason I booked at this hotel was for easy travel to a concert across the river since the ferry is right across the street.  Luckily they have me a refund and we went down to the Hyatt which ended up being better and cheaper!
Don't waste your time staying here just go to the Hyatt with better views and cleaner and nicer staff.
We've stayed here before and I mistakenly reserved here for a recent stay. $25/day parking, $10/day fridge, but free use of microwave in lobby. This place nickel and dimed us so much I realized it's probably better to pay more and have all those "extras" already wrapped into your room charge. 

That and the noise we experienced during this stay was very, very annoying! Less than half an hour of getting to our room, we called the front desk and asked if we could get another room because of the noise coming from TWO nearby rooms. The front desk said no, as the underlying problem still wouldn't be resolved. They said they'd call the offending rooms and request for them to quiet down. An HOUR later, the front desk calls OUR room, saying there was a complaint about noise coming from our room!!! WE HAD TO TELL THEM THAT WE WERE THE ONES THAT CALLED, AND THAT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM NEXT DOOR!!! They got it totally twisted AND it took them and hour to "deal" with the problem.

Google maps will send you to the wrong place. Depressing room with the sliver of a view of the bridge. Stay elsewhere!
The Holiday Inn Express at Penn's Landing experience was exactly what I have come to expect: courteous, clean, friendly and efficient. Check in was a breeze and my room was in perfect shape. Nice touch with free coffee in the room and the complimentary breakfast was really good. The neighborhood is great as well, close to the water with shops and restaurants and lots of public space. I keep coming back to Holiday Inn Express because I know I'll get a good nights rest with no fuss. The Penn's Landing location is definitely a home away from home.
This Holiday Inn Express is conveniently located on the east side of center city Philadelphia along the Delaware River. Riverfront rooms get a great view of the Ben Franklin Bridge and a nice swath of the Delaware River. The staff is always friendly and helpful.  There is usually a crowd at the free breakfast but there is plenty of seating. If that isn't your thing, go to Reading Terminal Market for tons of food selection and you'll see a nice section of the city along the way. Rooms are comfortable if a bit small. But you're here to see the city, right?
Staff was super friendly.  Room, bed, and breakfast were average.   We stayed on the 9th floor and had a good view of the bridge and the Delaware River.  Only one of the two elevators was working during our two-night stay.
Everyone here is exceptional. The front desk staff, the shuttle driver Daniel, the staff that work throughout the hotel....Everyone! I jyst came from a four star hotel the day prior and the service was not nearly as good. I would come back again.
I've actually never stayed here, but I'm a Lyft driver and I stop here sometimes to use the bathroom and it's the cleanest one of all the places I stop; even the soap is the foam kind which I like and it smells really good. If this is how the public bathroom is, then I can only imagine that the total service here is top shelf :)
We stayed two nights at this hotel. It was close to both concert venues we were attending-BB&T Pavilion and and the Festival Pier. Rooms were clean and breakfast selections were varied. I was in a lower room the first night and it was too loud for me to sleep. When I asked about a higher floor the manager not only moved us up to a higher floor but gave us a discount. I love it when you get more than you asked for!!!! It's not fancy but I'd recommend it for any one attending concerts nearby.
This Holiday Inn renewed my faith in the group as my most recent stay in another city (Boston) had left a lot of doubt in my mind on the type of quality I would find. We arrived early in the day after driving in and they were able to give us a room so that we could drop our bags and start our tour of the city. The front desk staff were very helpful in giving suggestions on where to start. The first morning I found that our Keurig in the room was not working. I mentioned it to the staff at the front desk while I picked up breakfast from the buffet (very nice by the way with a lot of choices) and within an hour I had a new Keurig (the maintenance staff opened the box in front of me) installed. That's the treatment I have come to expect from Holiday Inn so I am back to being a fan.
If I have to put in a negative, if you are someone who has to have total silence when you sleep, ask for a room away from the roads. It did not personally bother me but you could hear it non-stop when awake.
You can smell the old cigarette smoke as soon as you enter your room. I was checked into a room that had not been made up yet. The highway noise outside is continual. The elevators failed multiple times. The toilet seats are made of cheap plastic and mine was just about broken apart. The part of town is interesting with lots of eateries on 2nd and Market. Race Street Cafe is great (a short walk). But I would never stay here if I were paying for it, or if the hotels were not all full. Extremely expensive for a very crappy, rundown hotel!
In my opinion pay for hotel and  for Parking 30$ separately is ridicules. And gum are not gum. Too small for everyone and everything, not enough air, and space.
Reasonably priced hotel in a fun area of Philadelphia. The front desk staff were very professional, even when I observed them dealing with a difficult guest. The rest of the staff I came in contact with were very friendly as well. The rooms are upgraded, clean, and comfy. Complimentary breakfast is always a plus. 25 dollars to park your car, but that is typical for almost every hotel in Philadelphia.
Great location. Great hotel. Walking distance to Center City.  Breakfast was good. Sleeping next to noisy I-95 could be a bother for some. Staff was very friendly
The best part of this stay was the van driver . He was like a tour guide and happy to tell you all about the key points of interests. He even went beyond the range of driving to help me ! The views are great , the location is nice . Clean . God breakfast for what it is . The worst part is CNN playing all the time in the lobby . I have to wonder if CNN pays hotels and airports to air them on stop . It is really annoying .
This was a great hotel, close to festival pier, where we went to a festival.  However, they don't tell you that  they charge you $20/day for parking, but you have unlimited access to leave the lot. Also, I didn't quite like the guy checking us in. He gave us a hard time when we had trouble with our card and had to go to the bank. Besides that, we had a blast. The place was a little outdated, but it was clean. Mostly tourist.
Accommodations were pretty good. The hotel was clean and put together. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast area in the morning was really crowded but this of course isn't something the hotel can control. Hotel also had free WiFi which was a huge plus. 

The location was optimal to walk to Penns Landing and a short walk or shuttle ride (provided by the hotel) over Independence center to see the Liberty Bell. 

Only downside to my stay was the $25 per night parking fee.
Not only did my room smell of mildew. I tried to open the window to air it out and it could only crack. So I barely slept because the room smelled so badly and affected my sinus, but to top it all off, the bed sheet had a big whole so everytime I moved my leg my toe got caught in it. Dissatisfied does not begin to explain my stay at your establishment. I guess this is what you think your guests deserve to pay to sleep on. 

I wish there was a negative review I could choose.
Stayed here the night of the NHL stadium series at Lincoln Financial Field. The hotel was packed with game goers like us, but everything was organized and relatively quiet considering. The rates were reasonable, as was the parking charge ($30), and you can leave the car up until 4pm on the day of check out. The staff were very helpful with late check in and late check out and they were always friendly. The rooms were updated and clean. The beds were not the most comfortable ever, but still ok. The linens and pillows were nice quality.
 I appreciate holiday inn's green option of full size bath products in refillable containers. We did not take advantage of the complimentary breakfast in the morning but it looked lovely.  There is free coffee in the lobby all day. 
I'm giving 4 stars because the lighting in the rooms was terrible and felt very dark even with all the lights on, and the keurig coffee in the room was terrible. It would also have been nice to have a couple complimentary bottles of water in the in-room fridge. Beyond that, our short stay was a nice experience and I would probably return to this hotel.
Pros:  The rooms were very nicely decorated. The bed and the pillows were also very comfortable. The breakfast was one of the best we have had.  They have a shuttle van to take you to the historical district which is very nice and convenient.

CONS: The parking charge!!!  $30 per night!!!  I mean give us a break people. The parking lot seems to be part of the hotel property, I mean it is right there the same property, but they claim the parking lot is "sublet" to a separate vendor hence the $30 charge. This is the most annoying explanation I have ever heard of!!!

Also it is quite noisy at night, in the facing rooms, as cars and trucks speed up and down Columbus Blvd. which at times sounds like a drag strip.
I really wanted to give this review a 1, solely based on the poor level of customer service provided by one of the INCREDIBLY unpleasant individuals on the 3pm-11pm shift. A rating of 1 isn't fair though as the property itself is well-maintained and most of the other staff we interacted with were much more pleasant.

As soon as we walked into the hotel, you could tell the front desk agent was in a mood, while the other was helping another guest. The lady, didn't look at us once but asked the gentlemen at the desk, "do they need help?" No, I guess we are standing at the front desk with 5 bags for absolutely no reason. After 10 minutes, she reluctantly helped us, by finally (in a stern tone) saying "what can I do for you". After checking us in, without providing any hotel details, she assisted the couple behind us...very happily might I add, making me question whether this was a racial profiling issue. 

GET IT TOGETHER. As a front desk agent, you are the face of the hotel and if you don't know how to be pleasant to every single guest that walks into your property, then you have no business working there.
Worst Hotel Ever!!! The hotel is not sound proof. You will hear the noise from the other room including the noise of the car that's just passing by in the highway, can't sleep and you can't rest at this hotel at all.. Please don't book on this hotel.
If you are going to have a shuttle with your hotel name all over it, I would suggest hiring safe drivers.  I was crossing a walk way as your van rolled through their stop sign.  When I gestured as if to say, what are you doing? (As they were coming towards me), the driver made a point to speed around me in annoyance.  You can do better, they represent you and the brand.
i arrived in this one to stay over the christmas holidays , that was cheap!! might be because of the time of the year but 76 bucks for a 10th floor room with a view is pretty much amazing!
we arrived a tad early but the front desk lady Cynthia was friendly enough to check us in already! she could not give us the room we were booked for but made that up with a room with a view. when we entered the room we were quite stunned, a view? what a view!!! we looked literally directly on Ben Franklin Bridge and its lit up beautiful at night! even the window opened a tiny little bit, and i like that a lot when the room is not totally shut down.
the hotel is walking distance to everything( well if you are walking anyways...) we went to the christmas market and to ritterhouse square and it was an easy stroll. 
the parking is 25$ and they ad it right to the room.
they have free breakfast like every holiday inn but i normally don't go there its always the same stuff and they get it all delivered , no local stuff no effort there.
they also have a business center with a printer.
the good deal also includes a shuttle that takes you up to 2 miles around the property , we got his phone number at the front desk.
if we come back we surly check the rates of this property again, and might stay another time.
We went into philly for NYE. This hotel was a great place to stay!  We had our choice of party makers unpin arrival. There was a table of assorted cookies and water. Hot coffee bar too. After settling in we wanted to sit and have a cocktail somewhere. The staff recommended race street cafe one block up and about a 1/4 way up race street! The place was small but ran very effectively as crowded as it was. We had 2 drinks and nachos ehh h were yummy! Highly recommend. 
We passed another restaurant on the way called La Peg which looked great! Had an outdoor area with a fire pit and benches! 
Our room was clean and nicely decorated!  The only negative thing I can say was going to our room the key didn't work, hubby went back down to front desk for them to give us new cards. The bathroom was clean but little counter space on sink!  Breakfast was great! Coffee full and the Buffett was stocked well with lots of choices!
I would recommend thus hotel!
This was the worst night of sleep I may have ever gotten in my life. 

I really like Holiday Inn Expresses and the facilities here are actually quite nice. The accommodations were great and the staff was excellent. The issue that I have it that the building is located right next to I-95. Our room faced the highway and it was so incredibly loud the entire night. I barely slept and did not feel rested at all. 

The location is great - close to everything. I might recommend that you request a room on the opposite side of the building.
