DO NOT GO HERE WHATEVER YOU DO. The owner is a complete scammer. Puts herself on restaurant.com for advertising (she admits this!!) and refuses to take the certificates because she wants you to pay full bill. She is a complete and total crazy person. Refused to give my credit card back to me until the cops came. Save yourself the trouble and get sushi elsewhere- literally anywhere else in philly is better.
It's run by Ryo from Tokyo, he used to own Maru Global on 10th street.  It's super cute inside.  I had the gyudon (beef bowl) which was delicious.  It's quiet and you can order drinks from Madame Saito's next door.
SERIOUS WARNING:  DO NOT buy a restaurant.com gift card from here or eat here in general. In the end, the Madame will claim that she does not honor your gift card, after the horrendous sushi you have just consumed, and withhold your credit card. Complete scam, the cops were called, and legal action has been started against this restaurant. Avoid.
